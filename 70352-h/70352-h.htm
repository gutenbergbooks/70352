<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> little book pretends to be neither a Life of
Wren nor a detailed record of his achievement.
His working years were more than seventy. At
fifteen the inventor of a weather-clock and the
author of a Theory of Trigonometry which delighted
Sir Charles Scarborough, he died in his ninety-first
year, not indeed in professional harness, but still
working at the multitudinous problems to which
his life had been devoted.</p>

<p>When the definitive “Life and Works” comes to
be written, it will itself be someone’s life-work, if it
is to be adequate.</p>

<p>I attempt no more than to give impressions of the
many sides of a great Englishman, and have taken
the liberty to ignore the chronological order which
is fitting in a biography.</p>

<p>My old friend Henry Wheatley pleased himself
with the notion that people who write get a grossly
unfair share of the world’s praise, for the relative
greatness of men is judged by what writers say of
them, and writers are obsessed by the importance
of their own craft.</p>

<p>It is also true that architecture has been in
England an inarticulate trade, and one regarded in
our generation as a technical mystery with which
we are little concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>The greatness of Wren has been obscured by the
modesty which checked any inclination he may have
had to enshrine his thought in writing, save in few
and disjointed but admirable fragments on science
and architecture: in any case his prodigious output
of building left little time for his pen.</p>

<p>It is because Sir Christopher Wren brought to his
superb architectural accomplishment the equipment
of a mathematician, of a master of natural science,
and of a scholar, that it is what it is. He has been
called the English Leonardo. The praise, though
great, is not excessive, but the parallel falls short
of completeness. Leonardo was poet and mystic
as well as painter, sculptor, scientist, and philosopher.
But if Wren did not carry his head in the
clouds, he was still something more than our architect
of greatest achievement. He was a man of
scientific and intellectual stature worthy to be
measured with our best. He was, above all, a great
English gentleman. His contemporaries knew his
quality: it were very shame if we ignored it. The
Bicentenary Celebrations have given us opportunity
to pay the homage due.</p>

<p>&#160; &#160; <i>February 25, 1923.</i><br>

&#160; &#160; death of Wren.</i>)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AUTHORITIES
AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Parentalia or Memoirs of the Wrens</i>, by Christopher,
the son of Sir Christopher, is the main source
of information about the great architect. It is as ill-constructed
a book as one may meet, yet it possesses
a charm of its own. Christopher’s idea of a biography
seems to have been to print notes, letters, and discourses
as they came to his hand, without any thread
of text to give coherence to very diverse material.
The result is a rather forbidding publication, which
demands of the reader no little resolution. The
<i>Parentalia</i> deals not only with Sir Christopher, but
with his father, Dean Christopher, and his uncle,
Bishop Matthew. The father, as Registrar of the
Order of the Garter and Dean of Windsor, and the
uncle, as Bishop of Ely, filled no small parts in the
Church history of their day; but we are little concerned
with them here, except as they came into
Sir Christopher’s life.</p>

<p>This ill-compiled miscellany when completed by
the younger Christopher, who died in 1747, was
published by his son Stephen in 1750. It served
as a mine for the <i>Lives</i> by Elmes, Miss Phillimore,
and Miss Milman, and has necessarily been consulted
freely by all who have made Wren the subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
of their pens. In 1903 that part of the <i>Parentalia</i>
which referred to Sir Christopher was reprinted by
Mr. C. R. Ashbee at the Essex House Press, and
twenty fine drawings of Wren’s churches by E. H.
New were reproduced. It is finely printed, and
Mr. Ernest J. Enthoven’s editing ensured an
accurate transcript of the original edition as published
by Stephen Wren. To the kindness of
Mr. New and Mr. Enthoven I owe the permission
to reproduce here some of the former’s drawings.
Stephen Wren was unmarried, but contrived to beget
a daughter, Margaret, who took the name of Wren.
For her a copy of the <i>Parentalia</i> was bound sumptuously
in red leather, tooled and gilt. It bears the
initials “M. W.” and Margaret’s autograph appears
on the title-page. Interleaved in this delightful
and unique volume are many manuscripts, autograph
letters, and engravings. Some are in connection
with the Dean and the Bishop, but most
have to do with Sir Christopher. About 1908 I
became acquainted with Mrs. Pigott, <i>née</i> Catherine
Wren-Hoskyns, the last surviving direct descendant
of Sir Christopher. She was then old and in ill-health,
and contemplated bequeathing the heirloom
copy to a distant collateral. I persuaded her to
allow me to collect a suitable sum of money which
she might bequeath instead, and the story of that
piece of mendicancy, with a list of the people who
generously backed me, is deposited with the heirloom
copy in the Library of the Royal Institute of British
Architects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>Amongst the manuscripts of the heirloom <i>Parentalia</i>
is a chronological <i>Series Vitæ et Actorum
Domini Christophori Wren</i> in four pages. This is
a copy, perhaps even may be the draft, of the list
in the Lansdowne Manuscript at the British Museum,
which was initialed by Sir Christopher himself
about a year before he died.</p>

<p>I am bound to say, however, that even a list so
apparently authentic gives me no confidence.
Wren was the last man to be interested in materials
for his own biography, and he was ninety when he
checked the list. His son was incurably casual and
inaccurate, and the Elmes, Phillimore, and Milman
<i>Lives</i> were based on it blindly, except in the case
of Miss Milman, who used her own judgment somewhat.
Elmes was laborious, and had access to a lot
of material such as State Papers, some of which
mysteriously got into his own possession; but he was
almost blind, and he dated his dedication to Sir
Humphry Davy exactly a hundred years before I
date this, at a period when biography was no exact
science. The time has come for someone to go
back to all the originals, including many which have
come to light since his day. I hope this work will
not linger until February 25, 2023.</p>

<p>For light on Wren as a scientist I make very
grateful acknowledgments to my friend Sir Daniel
Hall, K.C.B., F.R.S., an expert in the outlook of the
philosophers of Wren’s day. He will recognise as his
own a shamelessly large number of sentences in
Chapter IV. Professor Hinks, F.R.S., the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
Gresham Professor of Astronomy, has helped me
with notes on that aspect of his great predecessor’s
activities. Mr. Wells, the reigning Warden of
Wadham, has kindly checked my chapter on
Wren’s Oxford days. There is a common phrase
for men of encyclopædic knowledge, that they have
forgotten more than other men ever knew. It
would be true of my old friend, Mr. Arthur Bolton,
Curator of Sir John Soane’s Museum, but—he has
not forgotten. He has been so helpful and full of
suggestions that it would be more honest if his
name were with mine on the title-page. But he
shares Wren’s gift of modesty as well as learning,
and I need only express an admiring gratitude. I
am indebted to the Duke of Portland, to the Warden
of Wadham, and to the Editor of <i>Architecture</i> for
permission to reproduce portraits.</p>

<p>I have attempted no bibliography, in which
Longman’s <i>Three Cathedrals</i> would have a prominent
place. That task and a schedule of Wren’s
drawings, with reproductions of those that can be
definitely attributed to him, will be amongst the
fitting works of the projected Wren Society.</p>

<p class="ph2">SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN<br>

<small>SCIENTIST, SCHOLAR, AND ARCHITECT</small></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>PARENTAGE AND CHILDHOOD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 20th October, 1632, Christopher Wren was
born in the Rectory at East Knoyle in Wiltshire.
His father, also Dr. Christopher Wren, is said to
have descended from an ancient English family of
Danish origin which settled in the county of Durham;
but I can find no authority for the Danish
story except <i>Parentalia</i>.</p>

<p>In J. W. Rylands’ <i>Records of Wroxall Abbey</i> there
is a pedigree which shows Sir Christopher’s grandfather,
Francis Wren, Citizen and Mercer of London,
who lived from 1552 to 1624. His father was Cuthbert
and his grandfather William Wren, of Sherborn
House, Durham, who died in 1539. This William
is described as brother to a Christopher Wren, of
Wythebroke, Warwick, who died in 1542, but the
authority is doubtful. If it is accurate, however,
it may be an added reason for Sir Christopher’s
purchase of the Warwickshire estate of Wroxall
for his son, who settled down there as a country
gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>Sir Christopher’s mother was Mary, daughter and
heiress of Robert Cox, of Fonthill, Wiltshire. So
on both sides Christopher was well born. He was
an only son, with seven sisters, but one of them only
is important in Wren’s story. She married, in 1640,
Dr. William Holder, of Blechington, Oxford.</p>

<p>We know nothing of Christopher’s mother except
her name, but his father cut some figure in Charles I.’s
reign. A loyalist of loyalists, he succeeded his
more distinguished brother, Bishop Matthew Wren,
in 1635, as Dean of Windsor and Registrar of the
Order of the Garter. When St. George’s Chapel
was plundered by the Cromwellian troops, the
spoils included the three Registers of the Garter
Knights, but by making a heavy payment the
Dean got them back again, and cherished them
until his death in 1658. They then passed into
the safe keeping of Christopher, who soon after
the Restoration handed them over to Dr. Bruno
Ryves, then the Registrar of the Garter.</p>

<p>Dean Christopher was educated at Merchant
Taylors’ School and St. John’s, Oxford, and his son’s
scientific attainments were inherited. He was a
man of delightful character, and evidently there
was between father and son the closest affection,
which shines even through the formal phrases used
in those days by children when writing to their
fathers. That he added skill in architecture to his
wide literary and mathematical knowledge is clear
from the fact that he was employed in 1634 to
design a building at Windsor for Charles I.’s Queen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
and a detailed estimate prepared by the Dean
has survived. As the building was to cost over
£13,000, it must have been an ambitious undertaking,
but it never took shape owing to the disturbances
of the time.</p>

<p>It was of great importance to Wren that his early
training should have been given to him by so able
a father, especially as he was, in childhood, exceedingly
delicate. The Rev. William Shepheard helped
the Dean as domestic tutor, and the boy’s mathematics
were looked after by Dr. William Holder.
Aubrey, in his <i>Lives of Eminent Men</i>, says of Holder
that “he was very helpful in the education of his
brother-in-law, a youth of prodigious inventive wit,
to whom he was as tender as if he had been his
own child. He gave him his instructions in geometry
and arithmetic, and when he was a young scholar
at the University of Oxford was a very necessary
and kind friend.”</p>

<p>Amongst the manuscripts in the heirloom
<i>Parentalia</i> is a letter in Latin, dated “E Musæo
meo, Calendis Januarii, 1641,” from Wren to his
father, beautifully written, and expressing filial
gratitude in a high degree, and below is a Latin
verse with its English translation. At the foot the
delighted father has written, “Scripto hoc, A<sup>o</sup>
ætatis suæ Decimo ab octobris 20<sup>o</sup> elapso.” It
was certainly a remarkable accomplishment for a
boy of nine.</p>

<p>Also amongst the <i>Parentalia</i> MSS. is a versified
paraphrase of the first to the fourteenth verses of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
the first chapter of St. John’s Gospel. The penmanship
of this is also admirable, and Wren maintained
this merit of legibility until the end of his
life.</p>

<p>Wren went in due course to Westminster, and
worked under the redoubtable Dr. Busby. His
father’s choice of the school was doubtless due to
the vehemently loyalist attitude of the great headmaster,
but it may also have been influenced by
the fact that Busby, though a notable classic, did
not frown upon mathematical and scientific studies.
Christopher was a Town Boy, and never entered
the College proper. Possibly it was at Westminster
that Wren first met Robert Hooke, with whom he
was to be so closely associated in after life, though
this guess is a little doubtful, for Hooke was older
by three years; but he was also a Town Boy, and
boarded in Busby’s house, going but little into
school. John Sargeaunt thought that Hooke studied
mathematics apart, and that this liberty was
probably shared by young Christopher. It is
likely that owing to Christopher’s delicate health
he left Westminster early and pursued his studies
under the eye of Sir Charles Scarborough, a young
but famous physician who had developed a marked
genius for mathematics and science. If Wren had
remained at Westminster, he would almost certainly
have proceeded in the ordinary course, like
most Westminster boys, either to Christ Church,
Oxford, or Trinity College, Cambridge: the choice
of Wadham was no doubt dictated by his friendship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
with the Warden. Evidently, however, Wren
retained an affection for his old school, because he
took much trouble over the design of a new dormitory
which led to a great deal of wrangling, and
the work of building was postponed again and
again. When, ultimately, the policy of rebuilding
was settled in 1721, Wren was ninety, and no longer
in practice. His design, therefore, was put aside,
and the Earl of Burlington produced what purported
to be a new one, but was, in fact, Wren’s, with some
slight modifications. The existing building, in fact,
which looks out on the quiet Abbey Garden,
may be regarded as a work of Wren, though technically
the amateur Burlington was responsible for it.</p>

<p>If we are to believe Elmes, it was not until 1647,
when Christopher was in his fifteenth year, that
he became acquainted with Sir Charles Scarborough,
but it seems more reasonable to ascribe to the
Scarborough period, following Wren’s retirement
from Westminster, a manuscript letter in Latin verse
to his father, dated September 13, 1645, dedicating
to him an instrument called <i>Suum Panorganum
Astronomicum</i>, and a tract <i>De Ortu Fluminum</i>.
On that assumption Christopher left Westminster
before he had completed his thirteenth year.</p>

<p>There is very little to show that Wren was much
interested in the graphic arts, but on the sheet
in the heirloom <i>Parentalia</i> which contains the
Latin letter is an ink sketch of a woman holding
up a dial-shaped object, which is possibly the
<i>Panorganum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>Possibly, however, this may be the sketch for a
design on the ceiling of a room which he did when
he was sixteen. It included “two figures, representing
Astronomy and Geometry and their Attributes,
artfully drawn with his pen.” I cannot
affirm that the lady in the heirloom copy is a piece
of his “artful” drawing, but it is likely.</p>

<p>What seems to fix the start of Wren’s studies
with Scarborough as roughly contemporary with
his <i>Panorganum</i> letter is the fact that the boy in
1647 was engaged in translating into Latin, at Sir
Charles’ request, Oughtred’s <i>Clavis Mathematicæ</i>.
In the same year he had a patent granted him for
a diplographic instrument for writing with two pens.
Christopher describes his invention at length. An
instrument of the kind must have then seemed
very important, because Sir William Petty patented
a similar contrivance in the same year. About
three years later someone stole Wren’s invention.
He was exceedingly annoyed, and wrote a letter
in which he refers to the fact that Oliver Cromwell’s
attention had been directed to it. Without claiming
anything great for the invention itself, he wanted
to clear himself from the aspersion of having annexed
somebody else’s device. In later years there were
to be many examples of people picking up an idea
of Wren’s, developing it to their own great credit,
and failing to acknowledge the man without whose
idea they never would have started on their
enterprise.</p>

<p>Whenever it was that Wren began working under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
Sir Charles Scarborough, it was not until his fifteenth
year that he informed his father that he was acting
as a demonstrating assistant to the physician who
lectured on anatomy at Surgeons’ Hall. The story
of his activities is set out in a dignified Latin letter,
which refers not only to the Scarborough activities,
but to Wren’s invention of a weather-clock, of an instrument
to write with in the dark, and of a treatise
on spherical trigonometry. Very impressive also
is a long metrical Latin essay on the Reformation
of the Zodiac, which runs to nearly fifteen quarto
pages, in an appendix to Elmes’ <i>Life</i>. He was
sixteen when he wrote (again in Latin) to Mr.
Oughtred, whose important essay on geometry
he had translated into Latin. We may agree with
Elmes that “these juvenile essays prove the
fecundity, the ripeness, and the highly cultivated
state of his mind, his zeal, and his ardent enthusiasm
in the pursuit of knowledge and literary
honours.”</p>

<p>But the weather-clock was destined to develop
from the stage of a “juvenile essay.” When he
wrote to his father in 1647 that he was enjoying
Scarborough’s society, he added that he had imparted
to him “one of these inventions of mine,
a weather-clock—namely, with revolving cylinder,
by means of which a record can be kept through
the night.”</p>

<p>Of this Scarborough thought well enough to ask
the lad to have one constructed in brass at his
expense. I find in Birch’s <i>History of the Royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Society</i>, vol. i., under date December 9, 1663:
“Dr. Wren’s description of his weather-clock consisting
of two wings that may be added to a pendulum
clock was read.” The engraving published by
Birch shows a far simpler arrangement than that of
the drawing among the heirloom MSS. The printed
<i>Parentalia</i> gives a description of a device more
complicated than Birch’s description of Wren’s
communication of 1663, and refers to a circular
thermometer designed to correct the error caused
by the weight of liquid. This does not appear in
the drawing; the thermometer is of the ordinary
air type. The printed <i>Parentalia</i> refers to Robert
Hooke’s improvements on Wren’s design, but they
only partly appear in the drawing, which would
seem to show an intermediate development
between Wren’s original device and Hooke’s latest
achievements.</p>

<p>The thing itself is of no importance now, but is
worth remembering, as showing not only the early
blossoming of Wren’s scientific achievement, but also
his patience and persistence in developing an idea
over a period of years.</p>

<p>All this was a good prelude to his life at Oxford,
which began when he was young to be an undergraduate,
by our standards, but older than we have
been led to believe.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>OXFORD CAREER AND EARLY INVENTIONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> question as to when Wren started his University
career presents considerable difficulties, but it is
worth exploring, because his youth at Oxford had
an enduring effect on the development of the man.</p>

<p><i>Parentalia</i> is explicit: “In the year 1646 and
Fourteenth of his Age, Mr. Wren was admitted a
Gentleman-Commoner at Wadham College ...
where he soon attracted the Friendship and esteem
of the two most celebrated Virtuosi and Mathematicians
of their Time, Dr. John Wilkins, Warden
of Wadham, and Dr. Seth Ward....” This date
is confirmed by the Lansdowne Chronology MS.,
prepared by Wren’s son, and initialed by Sir
Christopher himself two years before his death.
The MS. states:</p>

<p>“1646. <i>Admissus in Collegio de Wodham.</i>”</p>

<p>But it is necessary to consider other evidence.
R. B. Gardiner, in <i>Registers of Wadham College</i>,
notes that Wren’s caution money as Fellow Commoner
was received on June 25, 1649 <i>or</i> 1650.
Sir Thomas G. Jackson gives 1649 as the year when
Wren entered the college as Fellow Commoner.
Wilkins did not become Warden, in place of Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Pitt, expelled by the Parliamentary Visitors, until
April 13, 1648, when his name was entered in the
Buttery Book. On May 5, 1648, Wilkins had a dispensation
for twelve months from the full performance
of his duties in consequence of his attendance
on the Prince Elector, whose Chaplain he was. It
was not impossible that Wren should have gone
to Wadham at fourteen—the profligate Rochester
matriculated at twelve and was M.A. before he was
fourteen—but it is unlikely. Wren was exceedingly
delicate as a boy, there was no Wilkins at Wadham
to attract him there when he was fourteen or for two
years after, and he was, even in 1649, the first Fellow
Commoner entered during Wilkins’ wardenship. If
Wilkins took the year’s leave granted him, and if
June 25, 1649, be taken as the correct date for the
payment of Wren’s caution money, he went there a
month after the Warden settled down in his post.</p>

<p>If Wren had proceeded direct to Oxford at
fourteen from being under Busby at Westminster,
he would almost certainly have gone to Christ
Church, not to Wadham. Moreover, it is certain
that during his sixteenth year, and perhaps later,
he was very busy with mathematics and science
under Sir Charles Scarborough in London.</p>

<p>It is just conceivable that he entered at Wadham
soon after Oxford surrendered to the Parliament
in 1646, and that he did not come into residence
until 1649 or 1650, but no document has ever
suggested that, and the theory can be dismissed.
It is the opinion of Mr. Wells, the reigning Warden,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
that if Wren only matriculated in 1650 he could
not have proceeded to his B.A. in 1651, as in fact
he did. But the year 1649, accepted by Sir Thomas
Jackson, is feasible on the basis of Wren’s notable
precocity and the then readiness of the University
not to insist on three years, as is seen by Rochester’s
case.</p>

<p>It is, however, fair to add that the entry of
Wren’s £5 in the Wadham book is undated, but it
comes at the foot of a page headed 1650, on which
the preceding entry is dated June 25, and the
three previous names are registered by Gardiner
as 1650. It may be, however, that as the Wren
entry is undated, it was added later. On the other
hand, if he had gone to Oxford in 1646 he could
scarcely have occupied the then unheard-of time
of five years before taking his B.A., March 18,
1650-51.</p>

<p>I attach no importance to the MS. prepared by
Wren’s son Christopher, or, indeed, to any of his
documents, and prefer to rest on the College records.
Miss Phillimore followed the MS., but Miss Milman,
without setting down any evidence, assumed that
Wren spent three years in London between Dr.
Busby and Oxford. I think she did wisely, and
on all the evidence, obscure and conflicting as it
is, I accept 1649 as the year when Wren began his
Oxford career.</p>

<p>The rest of the dates can be cleared off shortly.
He became M.A. December 11, 1653, having been
elected a Probationer Fellow of All Souls in November<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
of the same year, and was made D.C.L. at All
Souls on September 12, 1661.</p>

<p>Wren was fortunate in the influence of the
Warden of Wadham, which was so powerful during
the formation of Wren’s character that it is necessary
to form some picture of the man. John
Wilkins reigned beneficently over the college from
1648 to 1659, and was described by Aubrey as
“no great-read man, but one of much and deepe
thinking; and a prudent man as well as ingeniose.”
As the late Dr. Wright Henderson, the biographer
of Wilkins, wrote of him, “his greatness fell short of
genius, for it was the effect of ordinary qualities,
rarely combined and tempered into one character;
but more effective for useful work in the world
than genius without sanity.” Soon after the Civil
War broke out, Wilkins was living in London as
the chaplain of Charles Lewis, Prince Elector
Palatine, with whom Christopher renewed a childish
acquaintance. Mr. Wright Henderson thinks that
Wilkins became the leader, as he was certainly the
friend, of the group of students of natural philosophy
who afterwards formed the Royal Society. It
seems obvious that Wren was entered at Wadham
in order that he might be under Wilkins. It is
certain that he became the Warden’s favourite
pupil.</p>

<p>It is evident from the amazing “Catalogue of
New Theories, Inventions, Experiments, and
Mechanick Improvements,” exhibited by Mr. Wren
at the “First Assemblies at Wadham College in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Oxford for Advancement of Natural and Experimental
Knowledge” which is printed in <i>Parentalia</i>
that Wren took all knowledge for his province.
There are fifty-three items, ranging from such
solemnities as the “Hypothesis of the Moon’s
Libration, in Solid” and “To find whether the
earth moves” through the uncertainties of
“Probable Ways for making Fresh Water at Sea,”
and the largeness of “Divers Improvements in the
Art of Husbandry” down to the pleasant simplicity
of “A Way of Imbroidery for Beds, Hangings,
cheap and fair.”</p>

<p>We are reminded of the association between
architecture and military engineering during the
height of the Italian Renaissance, by “To build
in the Sea, Forts, Moles, etc.” and “Secure and
Speedier Ways of attacking Forts than by Approaches
and Galleries.” Sanmicheli had invented
the pentagonal bastion: Inigo Jones had fortified
Basing House against the Parliament’s attack,
and had been one of the defenders. We would
give much to learn something of Wren’s invention
for “Ways of Submarine Navigation.” If he had
developed “Easier Ways of Whale-fishing,” it
would have given material for another chapter
in <i>Moby Dick</i>. <i>Eheu fugaces!</i> There is a hint of
the coming gramophone in “A speaking Organ,
articulating Sounds,” and “Divers new Musical
Instruments” helps to explain Wren’s devotion to
his daughter Jane, whose monument in the crypt
of St. Paul’s—she died at the age of twenty-six—shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
her in Francis Bird’s rather heavy-handed
sculpture as seated at an organ.</p>

<p>The technique of writing always interested Wren,
so it is natural to find in the catalogue “To write
in the Dark” and “To write Double by an Instrument,”
the latter a dodge he developed to the
point of patenting it.</p>

<p>The tools of his future profession already attracted
him. “A Scenographical Instrument, to survey at
one Station” is followed by “A Perspective Box, to
survey with it,” and there is a ring of Bacon and
Wotton in the compendious phrase “New Designs
tending to Strength, Convenience, and Beauty in
Building.”</p>

<p>There is certainly no more rightly prophetic
entry in the whole astonishing list.</p>

<p>“Several new Ways of graving and etching”
gives a certain colour to the story—though it must
be discredited—that Wren introduced mezzotint.</p>

<p>“New Ways of Intelligence, new Cyphers”
marks his early attachment to an amusement which
he shared with others of his day, though without the
need to use the art to conceal roguish passages in
what he wrote, as was the case with Pepys’ shorthand.</p>

<p>His later excursions into veterinary surgery and
the transfusion of human blood are heralded by the
memorandum “To purge or vomit, or alter the
Mass by Injection into the Blood, by Plaisters, by
various dressing a Fontanell.”</p>

<p>We have a glimpse of the experiments connected
with the working out of “A Pavement harder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
fairer, and cheaper than Marble,” as well as into
the social side of these Wadham assemblies, through
John Evelyn’s glasses.</p>

<p>On July 13, 1654, he was at Dr. Wilkins’, at
Wadham, and saw:</p>

<p>“Variety of shadows, dyals, perspectives, and
many other mathematical and magical curiosities, a
way-wiser, a thermometer, a monstrous magnet,
conic and other sections, a ballance on a demi-circle,
most of them of his own and that prodigious
young scholar Mr. Chr. Wren, who presented me
with a piece of white marble, which he had stain’d
with a lively red, very deepe, as beautiful as if it
had been natural.”</p>

<p>Two days before Evelyn had visited after dinner
“that miracle of a youth.” There is no need to
fill out the Wadham catalogue of inventions: we
can accept Evelyn’s valuation, and he never changed
his mind.</p>

<p>But the list from which I have quoted does not
complete the story of Wren’s early essays in the
scientific field, essays, be it noted, which are overwhelmingly
practical. Wren was a devotee not
of pure but of applied science.</p>

<p>It is probably at Wadham that Wren concerned
himself with what he calls Cheirologia. In the
heirloom <i>Parentalia</i> is a sheet with pictures of two
hands, and on the next page, another hand and
various notes showing the working of the deaf
and dumb language invented by Sir Christopher.
Though more complicated than the system now in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
use, it is another evidence of the agility of Wren’s
mind, and of his unwearying interest in varying
problems. But his time was not wholly spent in
the laboratory.</p>

<p>A curious incident at Oxford in 1650 gave occasion
for Wren’s poetic gift. A girl condemned for
murdering her illegitimate infant was hanged, but
revived later under the care of Dr. Petty and
Thomas Willis. It is an extraordinary story told
with a wealth of unpleasant detail in a pamphlet
called <i>News from the Dead</i>. Following the narrative
are some dozens of “Ingenious poems on the subject
by the Prime Wits” of the University, including one
by Wren. It is in a pompous vein, and cites
Orpheus, Eurydice, the Fates, and Æsculapius in
the fashion of the time.</p>

<p>Morgan reprinted the pamphlet and poems in
<i>Phœnix Britannicus</i>, where they may be found by
the curious. Wren’s effusion is only worth mention
as showing him in the full current of Oxford life: it
is likely enough that he had some slight part with
Petty and Willis in the long business of resuscitating
the young woman.</p>

<p>His fellowship at All Souls did not divorce him
from Wadham. In October, 1663, he was paying
rent for the chamber over Wadham Gateway which
had once been part of the Warden’s lodging.</p>

<p>That he long held in affection the scene of his
early scientific labours is shown by his having
designed and presented to the College a clock, the
face of which appears on the outside of the chapel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
The works were only recently replaced, but the
old mechanism is preserved in the chapel. In the
upper corners of the face are two armorial devices,
one of which appears to be the charges from
Wren’s coat-of-arms. There is also amongst the
college silver a fine sugar castor with an inscription
which states that it was given by Wren in 1653.
As, however, the maker’s mark dates the piece as
being actually of 1720, it is likely that, as often
happened, the old inscription on the 1653 piece
was transferred to what in 1720 seemed a more
modish design.</p>

<p>At Oxford he must have stayed off and on, after
his marriage in 1669, because he retained the
Savilian Professorship of Astronomy until April,
1673, when he finally settled in London.</p>

<small>FAMILY LIFE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> Wren’s mother nothing is known, not even the
date of her death. Of his seven sisters (the number
given in Rylands’ pedigree), the only one to survive
was Susan, who became Mrs. Holder, and wisely
used her great skill in nursing during her brother’s
delicate childhood. She was five years his senior,
and had no children of her own.</p>

<p>Christopher’s boyhood must have been clouded
not a little by the misfortunes of his stout-hearted
uncle, Matthew Wren, Bishop of Ely, whose son,
another Matthew, was a faithful cousin to
Christopher in later years. This is no place to tell
the story of the Bishop who, with eleven of his
brethren, was impeached for resisting the Parliament
in 1641, and went to the Tower. After a
short freedom in 1642 he was imprisoned again, and,
being charged with Catholic practices, languished
there while Laud was tried and beheaded, and,
himself never brought to trial, remained a close
prisoner until he was released by Monk’s warrant
on March 15, 1660. Broken though he was by
domestic bereavements during his eighteen years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
of captivity, the brave old man took up again his
episcopal duties at the age of seventy-five.</p>

<p>That he remained a prisoner so long was due to
his refusal to bow the knee to the new order. It
does not appear that Christopher ever saw his uncle
in the Tower, save on one great occasion, when he
made an unsuccessful effort to secure his release.</p>

<p>Wren was twenty-four when he became professor
of astronomy at Gresham College, and made the
acquaintance of Richard Claypole, husband of
Cromwell’s favourite daughter, Elizabeth. At their
dinner table Wren became a frequent guest, the
more welcome because Elizabeth Claypole remained
a devout Church of England woman. One day
Cromwell strode in and sat down to dinner, and
fixing his eye on Christopher, said: “Your uncle
has been long confined to the Tower.” To Wren’s
reply, “He has so, sir, but he bears his afflictions with
great patience and resignation,” the Protector made
the astonishing reply: “He may come out an
he will.”</p>

<p>When Christopher asked if he might take that
message to Bishop Matthew from the Lord Protector’s
own mouth, he got the answer: “Yes,
you may.”</p>

<p>But when the young man hurried off to the
Tower with his message, the Bishop roundly
refused to deal with the usurper on terms which
meant submission, and preferred to tarry the Lord’s
leisure and owe his deliverance to Him alone. A
loyal race, the Wrens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>In 1656, not long before this incident, Dean Wren
had died at Bletchingdon, where his son-in-law,
Dr. Holder, had been parson for some years, and
was buried in the chancel of the church.</p>

<p>It was there that Christopher must have met
Faith, daughter of Sir Thomas Coghill of Bletchingdon,
Oxon. Born in 1636, she was four years
younger than Wren, who is likely to have known
her since his childhood.</p>

<p>We know extremely little of the intimate side of
Wren’s life. The only document, but that a very
precious one, is the autograph love-letter in the
heirloom <i>Parentalia</i> written by him to Faith. It
is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>The Artificer having never before mett with a
drowned watch; like an ignorant physician has been
soe long about the cure, that he hath made me very
unquiet that your comands should be soe long deferred:
however I have sent the watch at last, and envie the
felicity of it, that it should be soe neer your side, and
soe often enjoy your Eye, and be consulted by you how
your time shall passe while you employ your hand in
your excellent workes. But have a care of it, for I
have put such a Spell into it; that every Beating of the
Ballance will tell you, ’tis the pulse of my Heart, which
labours as much to serve you and more trewly than the
watch; for the watch I believe will sometimes lie, and
sometimes perhaps be idle and unwilling to goe, having
received soe much injury by being drenched in that briny
bath, that I dispair it should ever be a trew Servant
to you more: But as for me (unless you drown me too in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
my teares) you may be confident I shall never cease to be</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Your most affectionate humble servant</span><br>

<span class="smcap">Chr: Wren</span>.</p>

<p><i>June 14.</i></p>

<p>I have put the watch in a Box that it might take
noe harme, and wrapt it about with a little leather,
and that it might not jog, I was fain to fill up a few
shavings of wast paper.</p>
</div>

<p>The letter is dated June 14, but there is nothing
to show whether it was written soon or long before
Wren’s marriage to Faith. His subscription is
hardly passionate, and we know from the enchanting
letters of Dorothy Osborne that even in Puritan
days such letters were signed, “I am perfectly
yours.”</p>

<p>Wren’s marriage to Faith Coghill took place on
December 7, 1669, at the Temple Church, but most
of his domestic events thereafter are connected
with St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, which was his
parish church. His first son, Gilbert, died an
infant. His second, Christopher, was born in
February, 1674-5, and baptized at St. Martin’s.
This first marriage only lasted a few years, for Faith
Wren was buried at St. Martin’s on September 4,
1675. Wren soon consoled himself, for he was
married on February 24, 1676-7, at the Chapel
Royal, St. James’s Palace, to Jane, daughter of
William Lord Fitzwilliam of Lifford. By this
marriage Wren had a beloved daughter, Jane, who
was baptized in November, 1677, at St. Martin’s,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
and a son, William, born in June, 1679. But Wren
was soon again to become a widower. His second
wife was buried at St. Martin’s on October 6, 1680.
It is rather surprising that there is no monument
to either of Sir Christopher’s wives at St. Martin’s,
although some tablets from the pre-Gibbs Church
are preserved in the crypt.</p>

<p>Jane Wren was, by tradition, Sir Christopher’s
favourite child, and when she died at the age of
twenty-six Wren suffered the greatest sorrow of
his life.</p>

<p>Of his son Christopher’s boyhood we know little,
but Sir Christopher wrote to him in France, probably
in 1698, when the young man was twenty-three,
a very charming parental letter, which has been
preserved in the heirloom <i>Parentalia</i>. It runs as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Son</span>,</p>

<p>I hope by this time you are pretty well satisfied
of the condition of the Climat you are in: if not, I
believe you will ere Lent be over, and will learne to
dine upon Sallad.... If you thinke you can dine
better cheape in Italy you may trie, but I thinke the
passing the Alpes and other dangers of disbanded armies
and abominable Lodgings will ballance that advantage:
but the seeing of fine buildings I perceive temptes you,
and your companion Mr. Strong, whose inclination and
interest leades him, by neither of which I can find you
are moved; but how doth it concerne you? You
would have it to say hereafter that you have seen
Rome, Naples and other fine places, a hundred others
can say as much and more; calculate whether this be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
worth the expence and hazard as to any advantage
at youre returne. I sent you to France at a time of
businesse and when you might make your observations
and find acquaintance who might hereafter be usefull
to you in the future concernes of your life: if this be
your ayme I willingly let you proceed, provided you
will soon returne, for these reasons, the little I have
to leave you is unfortunately involved in trouble, and
your presence would be a comfort to me to assist me,
not only for my sake, but your own that you might
understand your affaires, before it shall please God to
take me from you, which if suddenly will leave you
in perplexity and losse. I do not say all this out of
parsimony, for what you spend will be out of what
will, in short time, be your owne, but I would have
you be a man of businesse as early as you can bring
your thoughts to it. I hope, by your next you will
give me account of the reception of our ambassador;
of the intrigues at this time between the two nations,
of the establishment of the commerce, and of anything
that may be innocently talked of without danger and
reflection, that I may perceive whither you look about
you or noe and penetrate into what occurres, or whither
the world passes like a pleasant dream, or the amusement
of fine scenes in a play without considering the
plot. If you have in ten weeks spent half your bill of
exchange besides your gold, I confesse your money will
not hold out, either abroad for yourself or for us at
home to supply you, especially if you goe for Italy,
which voyage forward and backward will take up more
than twenty weekes: thinke well of it, and let me hear
more from you, for though I would advise you, I will
not discontent you. Mr. Strong hath profered credit
by the same merchant he uses for his son, and I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
thinke of it, but before I change, you must make up
your account with your merchant, and send it to me.
My hearty service to young Mr. Strong and tell him
I am obliged to him for your sake. I bless God for your
health and pray for the continuance of it through all
adventures till it pleases Him to restore you to me
and your Sister and friends who wish the same as doth</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Your most affectionate Father</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Chr. Wren</span>.</p>

<p>Poor Billy continues in his indisposition and I fear
is lost to me and the world to my great discomfort and
your future trouble.</p>
</div>

<p>It would seem that young Strong, the son of
Wren’s famous master-builder, was the boy’s bear-leader.</p>

<p>Wren is rather fretful with his son, and rather
melancholy as to his own health, but he was then
only sixty-six, and was to live until past ninety.
In a different tone is the letter to young Christopher
from his father, dated October 11, 1705, the original
of which is also in the heirloom <i>Parentalia</i>. There
is no longer the note of rebuke which followed the
young man’s extravagance in Paris. His taste had
changed, and Holland wooed him rather to the
buying of good books, a traffic the old man cannot
disapprove.</p>

<p>Poor Billy managed to live another forty years,
despite Wren’s desponding postscript. John Evelyn
stood godfather on June 17, 1679, “to a sonn of
Sir Christopher Wren, surveyor of His Majesty’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
buildings, that most excellent and learned person
(Evelyn never misses a chance of praising Wren),
with Sir William Fermor, and my Lady Viscountess
Newport, wife of the Treasurer of the Household.”
This was poor Billy, whose sponsors show that his
father was the intimate friend of Court personages.</p>

<p>William seems to have been very delicate, if not
defective. When Sir Christopher died he did not
bequeath anything to William, but left him in the
charge of Christopher. William lived on until
March, 1738-9, and was thus close on sixty when
he died. His elder brother, Christopher, survived
until August 24, 1747, when he was seventy-two.</p>

<p>That Wren lived on affectionate terms with his
son Christopher may be assumed not only from the
terms of his will, but from his having sunk most of
his fortune in an estate for Christopher’s benefit.</p>

<p>His own connection with Wroxall Abbey, Warwickshire,
can be set out in few words.</p>

<p>On August 29, 1713, he bought the estate for
£19,600 from the trustees of Sir John Burgoyne,
Bart., who had died in 1709. Sir John’s son, Sir
Roger, died in 1711, leaving a widow, Constance,
daughter of Sir Thomas Middleton. She was one
of the signatories of the deed of sale, and the younger
Christopher, then a widower, married her in 1715.
Probably the Wrens and the Burgoynes were old
friends, and as Sir Roger Burgoyne had left the
estate encumbered, the sale to Wren was doubtless
to clear off the mortgages. The estate consisted
of a fine Elizabethan brick house (since Wren’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
time very badly remodelled) and 1,850 acres, all of
which Wren conveyed to trustees in March, 1715,
bringing them into the settlement made on the
first marriage of his son Christopher, who then
became sole owner.</p>

<p>That the architect ever visited the estate we
do not know, but it is a tradition that he designed
a delightful garden wall planned in a series of semi-circles.
Certainly he never lived there. A succession
of Christophers owned the place until 1828,
when it went to the daughter of the last of them,
who married Chandos Hoskyns, a descendant of the
Sir John Hoskyns who was Vice-President of the
Royal Society when Sir Christopher filled the chair.
Catherine, the eldest daughter of Chandos Wren-Hoskyns,
became in time Mrs. Corbett Pigott, and
died in 1911. From her I secured the heirloom
copy of the <i>Parentalia</i> for the R.I.B.A., and she
gave me a copy of the rare Kirkall engraved portrait
of Wren, which had come to her from Margaret
Wren, daughter of Sir Christopher’s grandson,
Stephen.</p>

<p>I had hoped that Sir Christopher’s will would
include some personal expressions about his family,
but it is an uninteresting document, as anyone
who examines it (P.C.C. Richmond 65) may discover.
He characteristically provided that his
body should be decently buried without pomp, and
for the rest one sheet of paper was enough to set
out his dispositions. After reference to the trust
made at his son Christopher’s first marriage, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
leaves everything to him, desiring him “to take
particular care that my son William Wren be
comfortably maintained supported and lookt after
during his life.” The will was dated April 14,
1713, and proved at London on March 27, 1723.</p>

<p>I consulted the will of the son Christopher (P.C.C.
Potter 220) in the hope that it might make some
reference to the disposition of chattels, such as
drawings, that had belonged to his father, but it is
short and uninforming.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>ASTRONOMER, MATHEMATICIAN, AND NATURAL
SCIENTIST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sketch of Wren’s activities at Wadham (in
Chapter II) shows the variousness of his mind, but
clearly his many inventions, though they make an
astonishing list, were <i>juvenilia</i>. His contemporary
Hooke said of him, “Since the time of Archimedes
there scarce ever met in one man in so great perfection
such a mechanical hand and so philosophical
a mind”; and he describes a method of determining
the parallax of comets “invented by
that incomparable mathematician Dr. Christopher
Wren.”</p>

<p>In estimating the value of such an opinion, one
of very many, I am bound to rely on the judgment
of scientific friends who have generously helped me
with this chapter, because I can only repeat Professor
Lethaby’s comment on the same text: “These
things are beyond my knowledge, but I know that
they represent wonderful powers.”</p>

<p>We shall only understand the part played by
Wren in the development of natural science if we
see that development as the work of a team rather
than of individuals. Wilkins, Boyle, Lawrence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Rooke, Hooke, Seth Ward, Wallis, Scarborough,
Oughtred, Wren and many another shared a
common enthusiasm for the advancement of knowledge
which showed itself in common effort. Wren
was the man to whom his associates turned for help
in solving their individual problems, because of
his extraordinary ingenuity in inventing apparatus
which would establish or dispel the truth of some
scientific idea, and still more because of his ready
kindness and modesty. During the early days
of the Royal Society he was not only in an especial
manner the cement which kept together the whole
fabric, but the inspirer of much work which was
carried to fruition by others.</p>

<p>In 1645, the year when Wren invented, as a boy
of thirteen, a new astronomical instrument, the
first meetings took place at which was sown the
seed from which the Royal Society sprang. Dr.
Wallis, the mathematician, Dr. Goddard, Wilkins,
later Warden of Wadham, and Sir Christopher’s
father, Dr. Wren, were amongst the attendants at
weekly gatherings, when philosophy and especially
natural science were discussed.</p>

<p>When Wallis, Wilkins, and Goddard went to
Oxford in 1648-49, the London meetings continued,
but new meetings were held also at Oxford, first
in Dr. Petty’s rooms and afterwards at the apartments
of Wilkins at Wadham. When Wilkins
went to Trinity, Cambridge, the Oxford men enjoyed
the hospitality of Robert Boyle.</p>

<p>The London meetings were held often at Gresham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
College and, when Wren was fulfilling his duties
as Professor of Astronomy at the College, after
his Wednesday lectures and after Rooke’s Thursday
lectures. Lord Brouncker, the friend of Pepys,
John Evelyn and others were frequently at the
meetings, and the Royal Society took formal shape,
after one of Wren’s lectures, on November 28, 1660,
when Brouncker, Robert Boyle, Rooke, Wilkins
and others withdrew to Wren’s private room and
decided to constitute themselves formally as a
college or society. It was after Wren’s next
lecture on December 5, 1660, that Sir Robert Moray
notified to the meeting the King’s pleasure at the
constitution of the society and his promise of
encouragement.</p>

<p>The Society of Philosophers into which the young
Wren found himself plunged owed its inspiration
above all to the writings of Bacon.</p>

<p>Bacon was not himself a man of science in the
sense that Galileo or even Descartes was, for he
made no observations and arrived at no discoveries
in any particular branch of science. But he summed
up all the Renaissance revolt against Scholasticism,
and had set forth in a noble literary form a definite
system of knowledge that could be opposed to the
so-called Aristotelianism which hitherto had held
sway over the minds of men. Bacon’s guiding
principle was the appeal to experiment, for his
famous “method of induction” amounts to that.
The Scholastic writers worked by deduction. They
laid down their premisses, they worked out the laws<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
of formal logic by which they could draw deductions
from them, and they accepted the conclusions
without enquiring whether the premisses could bear
the weight of the superstructure built upon them.
Bacon opposed to this his dictum, “hypotheses non
fingo;” the business of the man of science is to
collect the facts without any preconceived theory,
and to let the facts themselves reveal the law
which binds them together. Actually, scientific discovery
does not proceed in this way. Without
a guiding hypothesis the mind is lost in a wilderness
of facts, but the value of the hypothesis must be
checked continually by its capacity to embrace the
known facts and to predict new ones. None the
less, Bacon’s method was at the time a necessary
summons to experiment, and under its stimulus
the young men of the day attacked the problem of
the natural world about them with the enthusiasm
of crusaders. For as a corollary to his method
Bacon had insisted upon the necessity of studying
the common arts and crafts hitherto regarded as
beneath the dignity of philosophy. In the operations
of the mechanic or the smelter, and in the
growth of crops, were to be found the materials of
science. So the new philosophers were universally
curious and their curiosity about things was the note
of the society in which Wren grew up and the
dominant feature of his own mind until he settled
down to architecture.</p>

<p>Wren’s scientific equipment was primarily that
of a mathematician, and to this he added an inventive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
turn of mind, which developed first in the
construction of apparatus and was afterwards so
nobly turned to account in his building. As a
man of science he touched everything and adorned
it, but he cannot be regarded as a supreme pioneer
in any particular direction, nor is his name associated
with any fundamental discovery. As mathematician
he was abreast of all the knowledge of
the day; he contributed to the advancement of
knowledge therein as in his discussions of the cycloid,
but even in that particular subject his work lacks
the luminous intuition displayed by Pascal. Nor
did he break fresh ground and conceive new
methods which afterwards developed into part of
the fundamental texture of mathematics, as Wallis
did with his theory of infinitesimals, or as Newton
did a few years later in a larger field.</p>

<p>Wren’s activity at the Royal Society in the
multifarious problems which its members examined
must not be allowed to obscure the fact that, <i>professionally</i>,
he was an astronomer. Gresham Professor
at twenty-five, and Savilian Professor at
twenty-eight, he achieved little that has survived.
The world and his own nimble mind called him to
an excess of enterprises. In 1662, his indulgent
friend Sprat wrote, “The Vice-Chancellor [of
Oxford University] did yesterday send for me to
enquire where the <i>Astronomy Professor</i> was, and the
reason of his absence so long after the beginning
of term.... <i>He most terribly told me that he took
it very ill</i> you had not all this while given him any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
account of what hindered you in the discharge of
your office.” Sprat stoutly defended Wren and
urged on the angry Vice-Chancellor that the rebuilding
of St. Paul’s and the fortifying of Tangier
(Wren toyed with the latter but refused it) were of
greater “concernment for the benefit of Christendom”
than “the drawing of lines in Sir Harry
Savill’s school.” It was not until 1673, however,
that Wren officially turned his back on astronomy
by resigning the Savilian professorship. The chief
document of his astronomical career is his inaugural
Gresham lecture in 1657, of which Latin and English
versions are printed in <i>Parentalia</i>. A manuscript
lecture, <i>De corpore Saturni ejusque phasibus Hypothesis</i>,
flits irritatingly by us as having been possessed
by one William Jones, Esquire, but after that—silence.
The Gresham oration was a little pompous
and for the “politer genii” whom he espied in his
audience.</p>

<p>“A time would come when men would be able
to stretch out their eyes as snails do (Wren worked
with a thirty-six foot glass at Oxford) and extend
them to fifty feet in length, by which means they
should be able to discover ten thousand times as
many stars as we can.” Of this Professor Hinks
says, “Rather poor stuff, suddenly rising into this
most interesting conclusion—‘and find the Galaxy
to be myriads of them, and every nebulous star
appearing as if it were the Firmament of some other
world ... bury’d in the vast abyss of intermundious
vacuum.’ What would we not give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
[Professor Hinks continues] for fuller knowledge
of what was in Wren’s mind when he wrote this
passage so strangely before its time, so strongly
suggestive of the island universe theory of spiral
nebulæ to-day.” There was also the matter of the
method for constructing solar eclipses. The lay
reader may be spared bibliographical details, into
which I have dived, but Professor Hinks makes this
significant comment: “Wren was the first to discover
the graphical method of computing eclipses
that, with some modifications due to much improved
tables, remains by far the most instructive,
though not the most numerically accurate way of
calculating ... and is in use to-day for the
graphical prediction of occultations.”</p>

<p>It was a practical thought of Wren that the
Monument should be used as a gigantic telescope,
and members of the Royal Society tried so to use it,
but failed, because passing coaches caused vibrations.
He had a like idea for the great south staircase
at St. Paul’s, but again, for practical reasons, it
broke down.</p>

<p>The biographers of Wren have made great play
with a story taken from a manuscript bound up in
the heirloom <i>Parentalia</i>. Miss Milman referred
to “the problem which Pascal, ... under the
pseudonym of Jean de Montfert, challenged the
mathematicians of England to answer by a certain
day. He accompanied the challenge with a promise
of a prize of twenty pistoles to the successful competitor.
Christopher Wren solved the problem,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
but for some unexplained reason never received the
prize, while the problem from Kepler which he
set in return seems never to have been solved.”
The facts are rather different. In June, 1658,
Pascal put out a challenge to all mathematicians
(not English alone) to find a solution for certain
problems connected with a cycloid, the curve
described by a point on the circumference of a
circle when that circle rolls along a straight line—<i>e.g.</i>,
a nail on the rim of a carriage-wheel.</p>

<p>In an appendix I set out the story as it has been
given me by Sir Daniel Hall. It is rather technical,
but may be summed up simply. Pascal received
both attempts at solutions and replies which merely
discussed germane matters. Wren sent a partial
but admirable contribution, unfortunately “without
demonstration.” It was original as far as it
went, but not the complete solution for which
Pascal had asked. Cavarci, the umpire in this high
contest, wrote that Wren had merely solved the
easy part of it.</p>

<p>It appears clear that in withholding the prize
Pascal wronged neither Wren nor the other contestants.
The suggestion that Wren was the master
mathematician of Europe will not do. It is enough
to affirm of him that he was an ingenious geometrician
who made several minor advances in that
science. He left no evidence of mathematical
<i>genius</i>, a quality which ought to be reserved to the
authors of far-reaching and fruitful conceptions.
The true significance of Wren’s mathematics lies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
in the fine way in which he applied them in his
buildings. No one is a better representative of
applied science as compared with pure or fundamental
science. Too much has also been made of
Wren’s work on the barometer. Some enthusiasts
have, indeed, tried to transfer to him the credit
which belongs to Torricelli and Pascal.</p>

<p>Wren repeated Torricelli’s experiment at the top
and bottom of a hill, and finding that the mercury
column stood at a lower height on the top of the
hill, argued that the mercury was really balanced
by the weight of the air, or, as we now say, measured
its pressure. But in this experiment Wren was
anticipated by Pascal; his experiment was regarded
by his contemporaries as made independently, but
it would be hard to say that the experiment was
really Wren’s own device, so much was the question
a matter of discussion among the men of science of
the time. The enunciation of the laws of impact
was made practically simultaneously by Wallis,
Wren, and Huygens. Wren’s may be regarded as
the most elegant demonstration, but it was Huygens
alone who perceived that when the colliding bodies
are perfectly elastic the energy of the system, <i>i.e.</i>,
the sum of the products of the mass of each of the
bodies multiplied by the square of its velocity,
remains unchanged—one of the generalisations
at the base of modern science. Similarly, although
Wren became Professor of Astronomy both at
Gresham College and then at Oxford, no outstanding
observation or fundamental discovery remains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
attached to his name. Speaking broadly and
generally we can say that Wren was universally
accomplished in all the science of the time, that in
several directions he showed a quality of mind that
was only short of the highest, and that finally he
abandoned the pursuit of pure science too soon to
have accomplished in any branch such a mass of
work as would mark him as one of the founders of
that science. It must always be remembered that
Wren took to architecture when he was just over
thirty, and was immersed in a huge practice when
he was thirty-five.</p>

<p>But perhaps Wren also was too universal. Perhaps
the very ingenuity of his mind led to distractions
in too many directions. It may be, too, that
his inclinations towards the practical fusion of art,
science, and administration, which found full expression
as an architect, had always tended to draw
him away from the pursuit of abstract science. We
may notice that even in the early days of Oxford
he was always the demonstrator and the contriver
of experiments at the meetings of the philosophers,
and later, in the early history of the Royal Society,
we find that it was to Wren that the Society continually
turned for the solution of almost any
problem that came under discussion. A letter
he wrote to Lord Brouncker in 1663, as to an
appropriate show when the King visited the Society,
suggests he was already distrusting his own skill
and pleasure in experiment. “<i>Sciographical
Knacks</i> (of which an hundred sorts may be given)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
are so easy in the invention, that now they are
cheap.”</p>

<p>The extracts from the Minute Books of the Royal
Society show the confidence of its members in Wren’s
universality of mind and constructive ability. At
the second meeting of the Society on December 5,
1660, when Sir Robert Moray brought the King’s
approval, “Mr. Wren was desired to prepare against
the next meeting for the pendulum experiment.”
A fortnight later the record states “that Dr. Petty
and Mr. Wren were desired to consider the philosophy
of shipping ... and that Mr. Wren bring
in his account of the pendulum experiment.”</p>

<p>Wren was at Oxford in the Spring of 1661, and
things did not go well without him. On May 8 we
find a resolution that a letter be sent him charging
him in the King’s name to make a globe of the
moon and likewise to continue the description of
several insects that he had begun. Sir Robert
Moray transmitted the royal command in a very
affectionate letter. The moon was duly delivered
to the King at Whitehall, who received it with
great satisfaction.</p>

<p>On September 4 there is reported some correspondence
with Sir Kenelm Digby and Monsieur
Frenicle concerning Wren’s hypothesis about
Saturn’s rings. Later there is a letter of Wren’s
which records that, although in 1658 he had made
a model to illustrate his theory of Saturn’s rings,
he had withdrawn this hypothesis as soon as he had
learnt of Huygen’s more convincing explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>On January 1, 1662, “Mr. Wren was requested
to prosecute his design of trying by several round
pasteboards their velocity in falling.” On the 8th
Dr. Wren brought in a scheme of a weather-clock.
On January 22 the pendulum experiment is described
at length together with Lord Brouncker’s
calculation of the velocity of fall, and at the same
meeting it is recorded that “Dr. Wren showed his
experiment of filling a vessel with water which
emptied itself when filled at a certain height.”</p>

<p>On February 5 “Dr. Wren was desired to think
of an easy way for a universal measure different
from that of a pendulum.” This was a question
of devising an absolute standard of length dependent
upon some natural phenomenon, which finally
found expression in the metre and again in a
standard of length derived by physicists from the
wave-length of light.</p>

<p>On February 12 “Dr. Wren proposed blacklead
as a better means than oil for preserving the pivots
of the wheels of watches and clocks from grating
or wearing out.”</p>

<p>On March 5 “the amanuensis was ordered to
attend Dr. Wren to take directions concerning the
experiment of water in the long tube.” This means
the setting up of a water barometer, with water in
place of the mercury of Torricelli’s experiment.</p>

<p>On September 3, 1662, it is recorded that “it
was referred to Dr. Wren to take care of making the
several experiments mentioned at the last meetings
concerning the <i>aquæ salientes</i>,” by which we are to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
understand the earliest experiments on the rise of
liquids in capillary tubes. The record goes on to
say, “The request of the Society made at the last
meeting to Dr. Wren about comparing the Earl of
Sandwich’s experiments was continued but it being
a business of difficulty and much calculation required
more time than he could yet obtain from
his other employments.” None the less, a week
later “Dr. Wren was reminded of promoting Mr.
Rooke’s observations concerning motions of the
satellites of Jupiter,” and a fortnight later still,
“Dr. Wren presented some cuts done by himself
in a new way of etching whereby he said he could
almost as soon do a piece on a plate of glass as
another could draw it with a crayon on paper.” At
the same meeting, too, “Dr. Wren proposed the
experiment of forcing up water in different pieces
of different diameter and different altitudes ...
and was desired to bring a description of this experiment
at the next meeting....” On October 8
of the same year “Dr. Wren offered an experiment
about the undulation of quicksilver in a crooked
tube which he suggested was for the velocity of it
proportional to the vibration of a pendulum. He
was desired to prosecute the experiment and to give
in an account of it.”</p>

<p>Sprat, in his <i>History of the Royal Society</i>, lays
especial stress on a scheme of work devised by
Wren in the interests of agriculture.</p>

<p>“The second work (the first was the Doctrine
of Motion) which he has advanced, is the History<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
of Seasons; which will be of admirable benefit to
mankind, if it shall be constantly pursued, and
derived down to posterity. His proposal therefore
was, to comprehend a diary of wind, weather, and
other conditions of the air, as to heat, cold, and
weight; and also a general description of the year,
whether contagious or healthful to men or beasts;
with an account of epidemical diseases, of blasts,
mildews, and other accidents, belonging to grain,
cattle, fish, fowl, and insects.”</p>

<p>Nor must we forget Wren’s anatomical and
surgical experiments. In his early Oxford days
he devised instruments (fully described by Boyle)
for making injections into the blood of a dog, which
he tried very successfully (for everyone but the
dog). He also skilfully removed the spleen of
another dog which “in less than a fortnight grew
not only well, but as sportive and wanton as before.”</p>

<p>Bound up in the heirloom <i>Parentalia</i> is a most
careful drawing by Wren’s hand of the anatomy
of the river eel. Instances of his versatility over
the whole field of science can be multiplied almost
indefinitely.</p>

<p>From the end of 1662 Wren’s name began to
appear less frequently in the records of the Royal
Society. His increasing preoccupation with architecture
and, later, his journey to Paris provide the
reason. But these extracts do make clear that,
even when he was preoccupied with science, Wren’s
energies were to some extent dissipated by the
universality of his interests and his practical skill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
as an experimenter. They can be accepted as explaining
why he did not become supreme in any
one branch of science, although any loss in this
direction was, perhaps, more than compensated for
by the richness of the experience and the breadth
of mind that he was thereby enabled to turn to the
service of architecture.</p>

<p>Though architecture became an exacting mistress,
he always kept in touch with the Royal Society
and, after a period as Vice-President when he was
often in the Chair, served as President in 1680.
He could not give the time to experiment, but he
was an effective stimulus in the organisation of
scientific thought, and took an exceedingly active
part in discussions which ranged from comets to
the making of jessamine-scented gloves with
daffodils, from Mr. Mercator’s new projection
of maps to the conclusion that “all wholesome
food should have oils” (which smacks of vitamines),
from the structure of peat to the contrivance of an
azimuth compass.</p>

<p>The incredible boy of Wadham days had become
the tireless President at fifty, immersed in the
greatest architectural practice of his century, but
still the enthusiastic scientist. I find it all very
astonishing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>BEGINNINGS OF ARCHITECTURE AND VISIT
TO PARIS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wren’s</span> work as an architect seems to have begun
in 1661, when, at the instance of John Evelyn, the
King sent for him to come from Oxford to serve
as assistant to Sir John Denham, Surveyor-General to
His Majesty’s Works. Denham was a moderate poet,
but no architect, and his appointment was merely
an excuse for giving him a salary. John Webb,
“Inigo Jones’s man,” had been serving Denham
as an assistant and was naturally distressed at the
interposition of Wren. This is no place to attempt
to estimate Webb’s place in English architecture.
He is put very high by some critics, but Evelyn’s
description of him as “Inigo Jones’s man” is probably
fair. He had attempted unsuccessfully to
obtain the succession to Inigo Jones, and, on this
second failure, he seems to have retired from
practice. The neglect of him in Wren’s favour
may have been a personal hardship, but nobody
will believe that English architecture was the sufferer.
Webb belonged to another generation, and
the indolent Charles had a right perception when he
summoned the scientist to shape the architecture
of the new era of the Restoration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>In relation to Wren’s later and definitive appointment
as Surveyor-General, there is a reference in
Pepys’ Diary which I never read without a sense
of personal relief.</p>

<p>On March 21st, 1668-9, Pepys met Hugh May,
very grieved that he had failed to secure the reversion
of the Surveyorship of the King’s Works, on the
recent death of Sir John Denham, “by the unkindness
of the Duke of Buckingham, who hath
brought in Dr. Wren, though, he tells me, he hath
been his servant for twenty years together,” and so
on, “and yet the Duke is so ungrateful as to put him
by, which is an ill thing, though Dr. Wren is a
worthy man.” It was a lucky escape for English
architecture, but it is difficult to believe that
Buckingham, or indeed anybody, even in such
venal times, would have denied to Wren the post
which he filled so perfectly, in favour of so sorry a
fellow as Hugh May. It is worth noting that when
May died in February, 1683-4, his post as Controller
of the Works at Windsor Castle fell to Wren.
If May had never been in charge at Windsor that
Castle might have been spared the indignity of the
Upper Bailey, which he designed of an ugliness so
surpassing that Wyattville’s remodelling, dreary as
it is, was a vast improvement.</p>

<p>How May saw the duties and opportunities of
Surveyor-General of the King’s Works is shown by
his consoling thoughts recorded by Pepys. The
King was kind to May and promised him a pension
of £300 out of the Works (presumably an euphemism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
for out of Wren’s emoluments), and that would be
better than the place, because, owing to the lack of
money, he would have had to disoblige most people,
being not able to do what they desire to their lodgings.</p>

<p>There are many documents to show that Wren
dealt assiduously and successfully with the daily
task of “lodgings” and other trivialities belonging
to the interminable routine of his post, but it is
evident that Hugh May would have done that and
no more. It was an escape.</p>

<p>For the first two years of Wren’s new appointment
as Denham’s assistant, he received no commissions
for public works, and when the King, at the close
of the war for Tangier, offered him the task of designing
the mole and fortifications he wisely declined
on grounds of health. The letter of invitation
was, it is worth noting, written by his
cousin, Matthew Wren, the bishop’s son, who was
secretary to Hyde, the Lord Chancellor. Wren’s
decision lost him a good salary and risked the
reversion of Sir John Denham’s post of Surveyor-General,
which was promised him if he would go to
Tangier; but we may be thankful that he resisted
even so honourable an exile, and he seems not to
have suffered by it. His early labours at old
St. Paul’s will be described in the proper chapter,
but his first original work in architecture dates
from early in 1663, if we except a doorway at Ely
Cathedral, of the same year. On April 29 he submitted
to the Royal Society his model for a theatre
to be built at Oxford for the public acts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
University. The Sheldonian struck a note that
was to become typical of Wren’s work, for he was
not afraid to adventure on a flat ceiling with a
span of no less than 68 feet. It was a cunning
piece of construction and covered in a chamber of
great interest but of uncertain design. In the same
year, 1663, was begun the Chapel of Pembroke
College, Cambridge, a thank-offering made by his
uncle, Bishop Matthew Wren, for coming safely
through his long imprisonment. Pembroke Chapel
is a fine achievement of much greater artistic interest
than the Sheldonian, and, being completed
long before the theatre, was no doubt the model to
which people turned, in Wren’s early days of architecture,
as the proof of his real capacity in his new
profession.</p>

<p>In 1665 he was called in by Trinity College,
Oxford, to design a new inner court with the definite
instruction that he was to build a quadrangle.
Wren protested that this idea was wrong, but
showed his skill in dealing with troublesome clients
thus early. Writing to Dr. Bathurst, then President
of Trinity, he said: “I am convinced with Machiavel,
or some unlucky fellow, ’tis no matter whether I
quote true, that <i>the world is generally governed by
words</i>. I perceive the name of a quadrangle will
carry with it those whom you say may possibly
be your benefactors, though it be much the worse
situation for the chambers, and the beauty of the
college, and of the particular pile of building ...
but, to be sober, if any body, as you say, will pay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
for a quadrangle, there is no dispute to be made;
let them have a quadrangle, though a lame one,
somewhat like a three-legged table.”</p>

<p>Wren had his way: the Trinity court is three-sided.
Elmes, in his <i>Life of Wren</i>, says that the
additions to Trinity College, Cambridge, were going
on at the same time, but this is a characteristic and
obvious blunder, for the letter from Wren to the
authorities of Trinity, quoted by Elmes, refers to
the filling of the library arches with “relieves of
stone, of which I have seen the effect abroad in good
buildings.” Wren’s journey abroad did not take
place until the summer of 1665, and occupied about
eight months. He started for Paris in the first
week of July, bearing a letter to the Earl of St.
Albans, who represented English virtuosity in the
French capital. So much we know from the reprint
in <i>Parentalia</i> of a letter which returned thanks to a
friend for getting him the introduction; but the
chief value of it for us is that Wren took the opportunity
to record some of his impressions. He was
enchanted with the collections of rarities that he
saw, and no doubt pleased himself with infinite
conversations about science and philosophy with the
scores of distinguished men he must have met.
But, unhappily, he was too busy to keep a diary or to
write home at length, and we have to be content
with a few, albeit precious, <i>obiter dicta</i>.</p>

<p>“... I hope I shall give you a very good Account
of all the best Artists of France; my Business
now is to pry into Trades and Arts, I put myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
into all Shapes to humour them; ’tis a Comedy to
me, and tho’ sometimes expenceful, I am loth yet
to leave it.”</p>

<p>Wren had a delightful and fruitful visit.</p>

<p>“I have,” he wrote, “busied myself in surveying
the most esteem’d Fabricks of Paris, and the
Country round; the Louvre for a while was my daily
Object, where no less than a thousand Hands are
constantly employ’d in the Works; some in laying
mighty Foundations, some in raising the Stories,
Columns, Entablements, etc., with vast Stones,
by great and useful Engines; others in Carving,
Inlaying of Marbles, Plaistering, Painting, Gilding,
etc., Which altogether make a School of Architecture,
the best probably, at this Day in Europe. The
College of The four Nations is usually admir’d, but
the Artist hath purposely set it ill-favouredly that
he might shew his Wit in struggling with an inconvenient
Situation.” This last is a shrewd bit of
criticism which did not apply to Wren’s own work,
for he always made the best of his opportunities.</p>

<p>It was the Abbé Charles who introduced him to
Bernini, “who shew’d me his Designs for the Louvre
and of the King’s Statue ... his design of the
Louvre I would have given my skin for, but the old
reserv’d Italian gave me but a few Minutes view;
it was five little Designs in Paper, for which he
hath receiv’d as many thousand Pistoles; I had
only Time to copy it in my Fancy and Memory;
I shall be able by Discourse, and a Crayon, to give
you a tolerable account of it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>He had evidently planned to spend at least
six months in studying French architecture, for
he wrote: “My Lord Berkley returns to England at
Christmas, when I propose to take the Opportunity
of his Company, and by that Time, to perfect what
I have on the Anvil: Observations of the present
State of Architecture, Arts and Manufactures in
France.”</p>

<p>Unhappily, his sight-seeing seems to have absorbed
all his time in Paris, and when he got back
the torrent of work carried him along and made
impossible the fulfilment of the final promise of this
letter. Wren had an easy pen, and it is sad to think
that what he had “on the Anvil” never got into
the muddled mass of manuscript from which his
son compiled the <i>Parentalia</i>. What would we not
give for more portraits of French architects and
artists like his thumb-nail sketch of Bernini, that
“old reserv’d Italian” whose plans for the Louvre
never went any further? In the result, we have
lost the observations which would have been a
great addition to the literature of architecture. He
did not confine himself to the buildings of Paris.
“The Palace, or if you please, the Cabinet of
Versailles call’d me twice to view it; the Mixtures
of Brick, Stone, blue Tile and Gold make it look
like a rich Livery: Not an Inch within but is crowded
with little Curiosities of Ornaments: the Women,
as they make here the Language and Fashions, and
meddle with Politicks and Philosophy, so they
sway also in Architecture; Works of Filgrand, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
little Knacks are in great Vogue; but <i>Building
certainty ought to have the Attribute of eternal, and
therefore, the only Thing uncapable of new Fashions</i>.
The masculine Furniture of Palais Mazarine pleas’d
me much better where is a great and noble Collection
of antique Statues and Bustos.”</p>

<p class="caption">WREN AS A MAN OF FORTY.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Probably Wren had little sympathy with the
efforts of that typical Frenchman Philibert de
l’Orme to invent new Orders a century earlier;
and is there a finer epigram of architecture than
the phrase in italics?</p>

<p>But his travels took him wider than Versailles.</p>

<p>“After the incomparable Villas of Vaux and
Maisons, I shall but name Ruel, Courances, Chilly,
Essoane, St. Maur, St. Mande, Issy, Meudon, Rincy,
Chantilly, Verneul, Lioncour, all which, and I might
add many others, I have survey’d; and that I might
not lose the Impressions of them, I shall bring you
almost all France in Paper, which I found by some
or other ready design’d to my Hand, in which I
have spent both Labour and some Money.”</p>

<p>Would that Wren’s collections and drawings had
been preserved with something of the faithfulness
which makes the Adam collection at Sir John
Soane’s Museum such a mine of information on one
of Wren’s greatest successors. One reference is
helpful as showing the source of much of Wren’s
detail, though the work itself is informing without
his note:</p>

<p>“I have purchas’d a great deal of Taille-douce,
that I might give our Country-men Examples of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Ornaments and Grotesks, in which the Italians
themselves confess the French to excel.”</p>

<p>It would have been better if Wren had relied more
on English decorative motives.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is silence in the letter on
the purpose of the jaunt abroad. Was the stay
in Paris the prelude to an intended visit to Italy,
or was it an end in itself? It is odd that he
should not have followed the example of Inigo
Jones and studied the Renaissance at its source,
but there is no written evidence that he ever projected
an extension of his journey southwards. The
effect of the Paris journey was to give a French
accent to Wren’s work throughout his life, and to
dilute the current of Palladian influence, which was
not fully renewed in England until the Earl of
Burlington, William Kent, and others returned to
Inigo Jones and his Italian master as the fountains
of inspiration.</p>

<p>It is useless to speculate as to how Wren would
have developed on a fuller Italian basis. His art
would have been more informed: he would almost
certainly have avoided the technical uncertainties
that mar some of his finest achievements: but he
could hardly have lost the freedom and inventiveness
which make him one of the most individual of
English architects.</p>

<p>One of the results of Wren’s French orientation
might have been that of becoming a follower of
Vignola rather than Palladio. In spite, however,
of Mansard’s work at Maisons and Blois, Wren,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
probably from the influence of his great predecessor,
Inigo Jones, remained on the whole faithful to
Palladio and the Ancients. As we shall see, the
two-order system of the exterior of St. Paul’s was a
practical necessity, and not an artistic preference.
There is evidence enough from his work that he did
not regard architecture as bound up with the
application of Orders to building, or as the only
means of salvation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>TOWN-PLANNING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> the most pregnant thing that Wren learnt
in France was the value of planning on spacious lines.
England was, in 1665, a country of mediæval cities.
Such classical buildings as marked the change of
taste were set down amidst surroundings of
picturesque confusion. If Inigo Jones had been
able to create the great Palace of Whitehall, of
which the Banqueting Hall is but a symbolic
fragment, the Grand Manner would have been established
in the land, but when Wren returned from
France early in March, 1666, there was nothing to
stimulate him except the Piazza of Covent Garden
and Lincoln’s Inn Fields laid out by Inigo Jones,
and his memory of the Place des Vosges of Henri
Quatre. Perhaps Bernini spoke of his great lay-out
in front of St. Peter’s.</p>

<p>The Great Fire of 1666 gave him the opportunity.
By command of the King, inspired doubtless by John
Evelyn, who was himself an amateur town-planner
of skill, Wren “took an Exact Survey of the whole
Area and Confines of the Burning, having traced
over with great Trouble and Hazard, the great
Plain of Ashes and Ruins; and designed a Plan or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Model of a new City, in which the Deformity and
Inconveniences of the old Town were remedied....”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe55_6875" id="plate03">

<p class="caption">PLATE III</p>
<img class="w100" src="images/plate03.jpg" alt="WREN’S PLAN OF LONDON">
<figcaption class="caption">
<p class="caption">WREN’S PLAN OF LONDON.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The outlines of his plan are seen in Plate III.
They provided that the Royal Exchange should
stand in a great piazza from which ten streets were
to radiate; three were to run to the river, the midmost
to London Bridge, and the river was to be
embanked from Blackfriars to the Tower. Round
the Exchange, on the islands formed by the radiating
streets, were to be built the halls of the Goldsmiths’
Company (the Insurance Office), the Mint, and the
Post and Excise Offices. From the Exchange
and running westwards were to be two great streets,
one passing the Guildhall, surrounded by the halls
of the twelve great companies, and another leading
to St. Paul’s. The Cathedral was to stand in a great
triangular piazza at the junction of the street from
the Royal Exchange and another running eastwards
through two great octagonal or round piazzas to
Tower Hill.</p>

<p>Westwards of the Cathedral Wren devised a
circular piazza from which radiated eight streets.</p>

<p>It was a gallant scheme which avoided all acute
angles, and set the parish churches on sites “conspicuous
and insular.” The streets were to be of
three magnitudes—the three greatest, which ran east
and west, and the two chief cross streets 90 feet
wide, secondary streets 60 feet, and no lanes less
than 30 feet. A great canal was to run from the
Thames up Bridewell northwards under Holborn
Bridge, and all offensive trades and those that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
used great fires were to be banished out of the
City.</p>

<figcaption class="caption">
<p class="caption">S<small><sup>T</sup></small> AUGUSTIN’S</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The King approved the plan, as well he might,
and then the trouble began. Wren worked out a
scheme whereby the freeholders of the City were to
surrender their properties temporarily to Commissioners.
Their areas and frontages were to be noted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
and new sites given to them on the new alinement
of streets with equal advantages as to area and
frontage, and, needless to say, vastly greater
advantages in amenity and ultimate value. No
proprietor would have been seated exactly on his
own site, but none at any considerable distance from
it, and the intelligent grouping of trades would have
been of advantage to everyone. But the individualism
of the Londoner overbore every advantage that
Wren offered him. He was content to lose the
chance of being citizen of the most convenient if
not the most magnificent City the world had seen,
and incidentally of benefiting his pocket enormously,
if only he could build again on the odd-shaped sites
that he had inherited from his forefathers. But
we must not blame the seventeenth-century Londoner
too much. Wren was an honest man, but
the citizens might well be suspicious lest his town-planning
schemes developed into a typical piece of
Caroline jobbery. There was the little affair of a
vast sum of money voted for a noble monument
to Charles the First. Wren designed it, as bidden,
and the money was forthcoming, but the monument
remained on paper, to the benefit of Charles the
Second’s pocket. Wren was an apostle of town-planning
born out of due time, and his vision faded.
We are constrained as the years go by to spend
millions in re-creating small scraps of his scheme in
the name of street improvements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>But the labour he gave to his great plan was not
all wasted. He perceived that the Cathedral and the
parish churches were architecturally the keys of the
situation, and when he came to the rebuilding of
both he saw London as a City marked by its churches.
Foiled in his attempt to set them as elements in long
vistas of noble streets of uniform houses, he at least
could determine that they should give a beautiful
skyline, and that the parish churches should be
grouped justly in relation to the great bulk of the
domed Cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>The picture of London from the Thames which
Canaletto drew in 1767 shows what we have
lost with the destruction of so many of Wren’s
towers and spires and the blotting out of many
others by the hideous incubus of Cannon Street
Station and rows of ten-storied warehouses.</p>

<p>Wren travelled much by the highway we neglect,
in a boat on the Thames, and he must have thought
much of the skyline as he passed from Hampton
Court to St. Paul’s, and watched the City growing
under his hand.</p>

<p>It seems clear that, defeated in his major design,
Wren determined on the next best policy of renewing
the skyline of the old City. Generally
speaking, he rebuilt a tower where a tower only had
stood and provided a spire where one had been before.
It is only from the lantern of St. Paul’s or from the
gallery of the Monument that we can now get
an idea of how entrancing London’s skyline was
when Wren died, but there is still enough to be
seen to mark him as a great town-planner and to
make the student breathe ineffectual sighs that the
London of 1666 was not worthy of him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>ST. PAUL’S CATHEDRAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Turner</span> said of Wren’s Cathedral that “the dome
of St. Paul’s <i>makes</i> London,” but the same shrewd
appreciation fell in better phrase from the lips of a
friend of mine aged seven. He had been taken by
his father to St. Paul’s, and on his return home
was observed to be drawing industriously. When
questioned as to his task, he held up a rudimentary
sketch of the Cathedral, in which the crowning
feature of Wren’s achievement loomed unduly large,
and replied: “<i>I’ve drawn the Dome of London</i>.”
I have met no better phrase of architectural criticism
in more than thirty years of reading. The monument
of Italian Unity has shifted the architectural
command of Rome from the dome of St. Peter’s to
the Capitoline Hill, but St. Paul’s still crowns
London with Wren’s dome.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher’s connection with the Cathedral
dates from 1663, when the derelict state of the old
church drove the King to appoint a Commission
to consider its restoration. It is not certain, though
it is likely, that both Wren and Evelyn served as
Commissioners; but little was done save casual
repairs until about May, 1666, when Wren laid before
the Commission a report descriptive of the state of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
the fabric with recommendations as to what should
be done.</p>

<p>There were two parties on the Commission: one
for mere patching and mending, another, with Wren
as protagonist, for a substantial reconstruction on
classical lines. Inigo Jones, when he added the
great western portico, had refaced the outside of the
church with big stones, part of a general scheme by
which the cathedral would have been re-fronted,
as happened to so many of the older churches of
France and Italy. Wren’s policy was to do the
same to the interior, “and it will be as easy to
perform it after a good Roman manner as to follow
the Gothick Rudeness of the old Design.” He
favoured a new vault and cupola, not of lead-covered
timber, but of “brick, if it be plaistered
with Stucco, which is a harder plaister.” The
essence of his proposals was, to remodel the
tower and crossing. He was, in fact, proposing to
remove the four great piers of the old crossing, as
Alan of Walsingham had done at Ely, where the old
central tower had collapsed. As Wren’s uncle was
Bishop of Ely, he was familiar with this bold idea.
“I cannot propose a better remedy than by cutting
off the inner corners of the Cross, <i>to reduce this middle
part into a spacious Dome or Rotundo</i>, with a Cupola
or hemispherical roof, and upon the Cupola a
Lantern with a spring top, to rise proportionably.
By this means the Church will be rendered spacious
in the middle, which may be a very proper place for
a vast auditory.” Here was the germ of the St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Paul’s which we know. On August 27, 1666,
there was a lively meeting of the Commission when
Evelyn, as we learn from his Diary, backed Wren’s
proposals against Chichele and Pratt, who were
against any new-fangled notions, and wanted merely
to repair the steeple on its old foundation. “But
we,” writes Evelyn, “totally rejected it and persisted
that it required a new foundation, not only in
regard of the necessity, but for that the shape of
what stood was very mean and we had a mind to
build it with a noble cupola, a form of church
building not as yet known in England but of wonderful
grace.” It is difficult to guess why Pratt, as a
pupil of Inigo Jones, resisted the idea of extending to
the interior what the elder master had done outside.
Perhaps Pratt resented the intrusion of Wren on
some personal grounds. Alternatively it is conceivable
that the Jones school were more impressed
with the merits of mediæval architecture than is
commonly supposed. As it turned out, Chichele
and Pratt were right about the solidity of the old
central piers. Contrary to experience outside
London they proved very difficult to demolish.
It may be that some tradition of the old Roman
secret remained in London, where old walls are a
byword for resistance to removal. If Wren had
known as much about mortars as the old builders,
much of the trouble with his St. Paul’s would have
been avoided.</p>

<p>After much argument it was agreed the innovators
should produce a plan and estimate. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
design is preserved at All Souls, and shows an inner
and outer dome surmounted by a lantern crowned
with a huge openwork pineapple 68 feet high, of
what Sir Reginald Blomfield justly calls “a monstrous
and horrible design.”</p>

<p>But the scheme went no further. On Sunday,
September 2nd, within a week of the Commission
meeting, the Great Fire broke out. By the 7th
Pepys saw the “miserable sight of Paul’s Church,
with all the roof fallen and the body of the quire
fallen into St. Faith’s.” Evelyn was there the same
day and infinitely concerned: “Thus lay in ashes
that most venerable Church.” The destruction was
complete.</p>

<p>Very soon after the Fire, Wren was appointed
principal architect for rebuilding the whole City,
and set about fitting part of St. Paul’s ruins for
temporary use in Divine Service. On January 15,
1667, the King made order to that effect, and on
March 5 a sub-committee was set up to do something.
They seem to have been lamentable dullards,
for they still harped on the idea of patching up the
ruins, and attempted to do so, despite Wren’s
protests. He seems to have followed the wise course
of leaving them to their tinkerings and to the
Nemesis of a tottering fabric, with good and inevitable
results. After the shattering experience of
the Fire, the new facing of large stones could not be
secured properly to the old walls. A year and some
money had been wasted before Dean Sancroft wrote
to Wren, then at Oxford, on April 25, 1668, to say:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
“What you whispered in my ear, at your last coming
hither, is come to pass. Our work at the west end
of St. Paul’s is fallen about our ears.” Sancroft
expected worse would follow, confessed that they
were helpless without Wren, and begged him to come
to London. It would appear that Wren was not
satisfied as to their change of heart, and thought it
wiser to let them muddle along into worse trouble
before he went to their aid.</p>

<p>They still went on patching until things got quite
hopeless, when Wren received a peremptory order
from the Archbishop and the other Commissioners
to attend with all speed. In one thing Sancroft
seems to have been wiser than Wren. He was all
for the planning of a “design, handsome and noble,
and suitable to all the ends of it, and to the reputation
of the city and the nation, and to take it for
granted that money will be had to accomplish it.”
Wren wanted to know what money they would provide
before he set about a design, and to delay action
until men’s minds were less distracted with all the
troubles that followed the Fire. After more argument
Wren convinced everyone that the first business
was to give up all ideas of patching and to sweep
the site clear of the ruins. This task lasted until
April, 1674.</p>

</figure>

<p>The story of Wren’s many designs for the new
Cathedral is confusing and need not be followed here
in detail. The First Design, made before the Fire,
has been mentioned. The Second Design, also known
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>as the “Rejected Design” and the “Model Design,”
was an attempt to gratify “the taste of the Conoisseurs
and Criticks with something coloss and
beautiful, conformable to the best stile of the Greek
and Roman architecture.”</p>

<p>This was one of several submitted to the King,
and was approved by Royal Warrant of November
12, 1673. A model of it was made, now in the
South Kensington Museum, and its plan and
perspective are reproduced here. It represented a
great break from traditional Cathedral treatment.
Planned as a Greek cross, to which a short western
arm (a vestibule or narthex) was added later, a
central space 120 feet in diameter was formed by
eight great piers carrying a dome, and the ambulatory
included four shallow domes. The octagonal church
of Santa Maria della Salute gives perhaps as good
an idea as any of the general scope of the scheme,
which Sir Charles Barry thought might supply a hint
for English church building. The western vestibule
was roofed with a smaller dome and finished with a
colonnaded portico. It was a noble idea, but the
clergy thought it unsuitable for services, and the
absence of chapels annoyed the Duke of York, who,
with his supporters, still hoped for a restoration
of the old religion. Wren had to abandon the
scheme, not, it is said, without actual tears. It is
recorded in <i>Parentalia</i> that “the Surveyor, in
private Conversation, always seem’d to set a higher
value on this Design, than any he had made before
or since; as what was laboured with more Study and
Success; and (had he not been over-rul’d by those,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
whom it was his Duty to Obey) what he would have
put into Execution with more Chearfulness and
Satisfaction to himself than the latter.”</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Plan of the “Rejected Design.”</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>About eighteen months passed before the Third
Design was submitted to the King and approved by
warrant dated May 14, 1675. It is known as the
Warrant Design. So unworthy is it of Wren’s
genius that his apologists have been ingenious in
explaining it away. Miss Phillimore thought it the
result of overwork and worry. Loftie believed that
Wren was “in the nearest thing to a bad temper
of which his meek and quiet spirit was capable,” and
pitched it at Charles as a joke, thinking that the King
might as well sign the silliest design he could produce
as he had rejected a sound scheme. Be that as it may—and
it is not very like Wren to play the fool—Charles
passed this preposterous design as “very artificial
proper and useful,” giving Wren “liberty in
the prosecution of his work, to make some Variations,
rather Ornamental than Essential, as from time to
time he should see proper, and to leave the Whole
to his management.” The design now reproduced
carries its own condemnation on its face. The
western towers and the portico with its single
skinny Order were exceedingly feeble, and the crowning
of the dome by a kind of parody of St. Bride’s
steeple is a feature that is best passed over in silence.</p>

<p>But if it were not simply a lark, it might have
been the result of a demand for a spire that should
remind London of the glory of St. Paul’s old spire,
which had been the highest in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span></p>

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">West Elevation of the “Warrant Design.”</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Happily Wren interpreted his permission for ornamental
variations by drastic changes in essentials
in the elevations, but he did not greatly change the
“warrant” plan. His frame of mind may well
be judged by the note, which follows the recital of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
the 1675 Warrant, in <i>Parentalia</i>: “From that time,
the Surveyor resolved to make no more Models,
or publickly expose his Drawings, which (as he had
found by Experience) did but lose Time, and subjected
his Business, many Times, to incompetent Judges.”
Therefore, just as the present Houses of Parliament
grew out of the castle design, done by Barry
in 1836, by his twenty years of thought and
work, so the grandeur of St. Paul’s developed with
the mind of Wren incessantly occupied in its
creation for nearly double that time. No one
could help him in this gradual evolution of his
thought, but many could, and did, obstruct its
execution.</p>

<p>The taking down of the vast ruins of the old Cathedral
made a heavy task, and Wren took to gunpowder
for demolishing the piers of the old central tower.
This worked well, but on its second employment by a
subordinate, when Wren was out of town, too much
gunpowder was used and a stone was blown into a
neighbouring house. No bones were broken, but
Wren was told to find less desperate methods and
achieved his end with “that ancient Engine in War,
the Battering-ram.” Wren’s troubles with the
foundations made a long and too technical story for
so slight a sketch as this, but it is fair to his memory
to set down that though some early trouble was
experienced from settlements which young Edward
Strong, the son of Wren’s master-mason, was called
in to repair, the present troubles are due more to the
draining of the subsoil by recent engineering works,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
such as great sewers, and to the use of rubble inside a
casing of ashlar, than to any defect in the foundation
design. One notable change in the design of the West
Front must be emphasised because it marks the influence,
in this case the overmastering influence, of
material over design. Wren devised the front with
a single great Order (as Inigo Jones had done in the
portico he added), therein following the scheme of St.
Peter’s at Rome. Bramante had quarried at Tivoli
pieces big enough for the drums of his columns,
but had to spoil his cornices for lack of stones of
adequate size. Wren was defeated in his hope of
securing drums big enough from the Portland,
Rock Abbey, and other quarries, and “for these
Reasons the Surveyor concluded upon Portland-stone,
and was able to use two Orders and by that
Means to keep the just Proportions of his Cornices;
otherwise he must have fallen short of the Heighth
of the Fabrick, which now exerts itself over all the
Country, as well as City, as it did of old, when that
Structure, tho’ rude, was lofty and majestick.”</p>

<p>The first stone of the new church was laid in 1675,
and during thirty-five years, from the forty-third to
the seventy-eighth of the architect’s life, St. Paul’s
was his constant preoccupation. Troubles were
many. The 1675 plan was without the two western
chapels (that now used by the Order of St. Michael
and St. George and its fellow on the north side).
They were introduced into the scheme by the insistence
of the Duke of York. But the fundamental
novelty of St. Paul’s, the double dome, was present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
in his pre-Fire design, and whatever else was
changed, that remained.</p>

<p>Persons of Revival Gothic mind have been much
troubled in conscience by the “falsity” of this
treatment, though it has the admitted result of
giving an absolutely right effect inside and out, and
has been followed in nearly all the subsequent domes
of this scale. The provision of an inner and an outer
dome is held nowadays to be justified abundantly
by the result. The brick cone that triumphantly
carries the lantern, which is as high and large as
many a church tower, is one of the many evidences
of Wren’s engineering skill.</p>

<p>The architect was fortunate in the men who carried
out his work. Edward Strong, the master-mason,
and Richard Jennings, the master-carpenter, were
faithful servants in carrying out the bones of the
great structure; and such artists as Grinling Gibbons
in the choir stalls, and Tijou in the wonderful iron
screens served Wren’s turn to perfection. At St.
Paul’s there is none of that carelessness of detail
which defaces many of the City churches. There
is little doubt that Wren was constantly on the works,
watching everything in detail, revising and directing
on the spot the great fabric as it grew under his
hand.</p>

<p>The cost of rebuilding was borne by the “coal-money,”
a duty of 1s. 6d. a chaldron on all coal
imported into London, of which four-fifths were
allocated to St. Paul’s. Even so the works were
often in danger for lack of funds, and money had
to be borrowed in advance of the coal-money
receipts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>The funds received from all sources, including
borrowings, amounted in 1700 to £1,167,474, but
part of this went in interest paid out and in repaying
loans and part in acquiring neighbouring property.
The net cost is given by Longman as
£746,661.</p>

<p>The choir was opened for Divine Service on
December 2, 1697, on the Thanksgiving Day for
the Peace on the Treaty of Ryswick. By 1708
the dome was ready to be covered. The Committee
wanted copper to be used. Wren held out
for lead, and lead it was and is. In 1710 young
Christopher Wren was deputed by his father to lay
the top-stone of the lantern which surmounts the
dome, and did it in the presence of Sir Christopher
and Edward Strong and other workmen who had
been engaged on the building. It was a proud day
for the old man of seventy-eight who had carried
through a unique task despite every difficulty.</p>

<p>He was treated with incredible meanness. From
the start of the work he had received the meagre
salary of £200 a year, and in 1696-7 an Act “for
the completing and adorning the Cathedral Church”
was passed which included the miserable provision
“to suspend a moiety of the Surveyor’s salary
until the said Church should be finished, thereby
the better to encourage him to finish the same with
the utmost diligence and expedition.”</p>

<p>It was a spiteful business, which Wren bitterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
resented, and not until Christmas, 1711, did he secure
the payment of the arrears of half-pay on the passing
of an Act which certified the Cathedral was finished.
But even then much remained to be done, and in
the doing of it Wren was hampered and thwarted
at every turn by the narrow-minded Commissioners.
It is a miserable story and hardly worth telling
but that Wren’s reputation needs to be defended
as to some features of St. Paul’s which he resisted
ineffectually. The squabble about the enclosing
railings is no longer interesting because they have
disappeared, but the painting of the inner dome by
Thornhill with opaque masses of figures instead of
the mosaic Wren had intended was a severe trouble
to him. Still worse was the insistence of the Commissioners
on the balustrade which crowns the upper
cornice. Wren’s letter to them in October, 1717,
was a vigorous protest for a man of eighty-five.
“I take leave, first, to declare that I never designed
a balustrade. Persons of little skill in architecture
did expect, I believe, to see something they had
been used to in Gothic structures, and <i>ladies think
nothing well without an edging</i>. I should gladly
have complied with the vulgar taste, but I suspended
for the reasons following.” The reasons were good
and many, but the Commissioners preferred to be
lady-like, and the balustrade was put up. This was
in 1717. In 1718 King George the First superseded
Wren as Surveyor-General in favour of a
rascal called William Benson, so incompetent that
he was dismissed ignominiously a year later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>In Wren’s own writing there appears in the MS.
chronology of his life and works an entry in Greek
which runs, translated:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>April 26, 1718.</i></p>

<p><span class="indentleft">And there arose a king that knew not Joseph.</span><br>
<span class="indentleft">And Gallio cared for none of these things.</span></p>
</div>

<p>He retired to his house at Hampton Court
observing “Nunc me jubet Fortuna expeditius
philosophari” and, in a strain of piety, which was
as truly characteristic as the Stoic note, “If I glory,
it is in the singular mercy of God, who has enabled
me to begin and finish my great work, so conformable
to the ancient model.” After more than
two hundred years we rejoice to add, in the words
of the Bicentenary Service, “We render Thee
thanks, O Lord, for the singular gifts which Thou
didst bestow upon Thy servant, Christopher Wren.”</p>

<p>The malevolence of his masters at the Cathedral
pursued him to the grave, but it gave his son
the opportunity of inventing an immortal epitaph.
Sir Christopher was buried in the crypt, but the
suggestion of a monument was rejected by the
authorities.</p>

<p>So the younger Christopher, seeking to explain
the absence of a fitting memorial in the place of his
father’s greatest triumph, wrote on the plain tablet
which marks his resting-place, as the closing words
of his epitaph,</p>

<p class="center">“SI MONUMENTUM REQUIRIS: CIRCUMSPICE.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>But the fatuous proceedings of Commissioners
and King alike have faded into their proper perspective,
and St. Paul’s remains the supreme
monument of the genius of a single architect.</p>

<p>What, in fact, did Wren achieve in the building
of St. Paul’s? Much can be written of his handling
of the Orders, of his structure of the dome, of the
details of the plan, and so forth; but there are
broader issues involved. St. Paul’s gave the first
opportunity since the Middle Ages for the creation
of a Cathedral in England, and Wren’s task was
a Protestant Cathedral. Hitherto the Cathedral
builder had made two churches under one roof,
a choir for Canons, whether secular or regular, or
for monks, and a nave for the laity, the two divided
by a solid screen which prevented nave worshippers
from seeing the high altar. Wren’s plan was a half-way
house between the mediæval type and the idea
of St. Peter’s with the high altar as the central
feature under the dome. It was a classical translation
of the plan of his uncle’s Cathedral of Ely, in so
far as it retained the aisle vistas by supporting the
dome on eight piers instead of four. It was English
in that it set the altar in a ritual choir well to the east
of the crossing. It was Protestant and characteristic
of Wren’s views in its provision of an admirable
“auditory.”</p>

<p>St. Paul’s Cathedral may fairly be called the apogee
of English Baroque, because it is the finest English
expression of what Mr. Geoffrey Scott calls the
Architecture of Humanism. It represents with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
peculiar faithfulness the outlook of the best minds
of the last half of the seventeenth century, for Wren
was one of them, and had the power to give it expression.
St. Peter’s, the only church with which it
is not unnaturally compared, was a <i>pasticcio</i> of many
minds brought to bear in succession on a far larger
but not æsthetically more difficult problem, and it
suffers from a consequent confusion, as well as from
its abnormal scale. St. Paul’s was the work of
one commanding personality, who developed indeed
in the course of its building—the difference between
the warrant plan and the church itself is proof
enough of that—but he did so consistently and with
a single aim. Westminster Abbey is the supreme
flower of Gothic art in England, if not in the world,
and the perfect expression of the Age of Faith. St.
Paul’s is a no less perfect emblem of what England
could make of humanistic ideals in art joined with
robust English Churchmanship expressed through
so sincere an Anglican as was Sir Christopher Wren.</p>

<p>St. Paul’s is incomparable—the word is used
advisedly—as a piece of architecture, and it is
prodigiously English.</p>

<small>THE CITY CHURCHES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> parish churches of Sir Christopher Wren
once numbered fifty-three. Of these, St. Andrew
Holborn, St. Clement Danes, and St. James
Piccadilly, cannot rightly be included amongst
the City churches, as they are outside “the square
mile.” Of the remaining fifty, St. Dunstan-in-the-East,
St. Mary Aldermary, St. Sepulchre, and the
destroyed St. Christopher, were only repaired by
Wren. Fifteen have been wholly destroyed, and
of St. Mary Somerset only the tower remains.
Only thirty therefore remain in the City, and of these
many have been so modernised that their value
has in part disappeared.</p>

<p>Many devout admirers of Wren have done his
memory a serious disservice by indiscriminate praise.
It is no doubt an amiable fault, but it does much
to confuse serious public issues, such as the question
of “the nineteen doomed churches” which has lately
agitated the public mind and will do so again. I
will not discuss here whether it is ever permissible
to remove any church, but if destruction can in any
circumstances be allowed, discussion must revolve
round the quality of what is doomed. It is common
form for disputants to talk as though all city
churches were Wren churches, and all Wren churches
perfect churches. In point of fact thirteen of the
nineteen were by Wren. Of the six that were
not, St. Mary Woolnoth, by Hawksmoor, is of as
great importance as a Wren church, and much more
interesting than many. Of the “doomed” thirteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
by Wren, St. Vedast Foster Lane, is said now to
be out of danger: the steeple is superb, the nave
merely a restoration with some good fittings left.
The leaded lantern on the tower of St. Nicholas
Cole Abbey, is exceedingly valuable, and its removal
would be a crime, but it would be a waste of tears
to shed them on the modernized nave. St.
Stephen’s, Coleman Street, also has a pleasant little
lantern, but if anyone supposes the interior is typical
Wren he cannot detect the more glaring feats of
the restorer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>In the case of St. Michael Paternoster Royal,
St. Michael Cornhill, St. Mary Aldermanbury,
St. Anne and St. Agnes, St. Alban Wood Street,
and All Hallows Lombard Street, there is enough
of characteristic Wren in tower or church, or
both, to justify retention; but it is difficult to
be enthusiastic about St. Clement Eastcheap,
now, and it cannot have been easy before the church
was modernized. If a hand were laid on a stone of
St. Magnus London Bridge, it would be an abomination.</p>

<p>The tower of St. Dunstan-in-the-East is unique
for its date, and of quite extraordinary interest:
any idea of removing it should be resisted with
vehemence. But why anyone should be the least
concerned at the disappearance of the body of the
church is known only to those who detect beauty
in the Gothic adventures of Messrs. Laing and Tite
in the year 1810. Of St. Mary-at-Hill the ugly
1780 tower replaced a mediæval tower which
escaped the fire, and the interior has been somewhat
havocked in latter days.</p>

<p>St. Clement Eastcheap has some good fittings,
but, always small and unimportant, its quality has
been greatly modified by the restorer.</p>

<p>These notes are set down in the hope that the case
for the maintenance forever of the nobler works of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
Wren will not be vitiated, confused, and, in the
minds of plain men, made ridiculous by hysterical
praise of his meanest buildings from which such
small quality as they once possessed has been
removed by modern vandalisms.</p>

<p>The achievement of Sir Christopher Wren was
vast, and for that very reason there must be discrimination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
between those buildings on which he
lavished his utmost personal care and those which,
in the press of a huge practice, were designed mainly
by assistants and carried out probably with the
slenderest supervision by the master.</p>

<p>A glance at the Chronology I print in an appendix
will show the sort of pressure at which Wren worked
during the ten years following the Fire. Examination
of the Accounts of the City Churches reveals
that payments began to be made in 1670 to the
builders of <i>seventeen</i> churches, and six years later
the number had grown to <i>twenty-eight</i>.</p>

<p>Actual work on practically the whole of the
fifty-three had been completed by 1690. None
was begun after 1686 and payments were made on
eight only between 1690 and 1695.</p>

<p>Wren did comparatively little after 1700 except
the completion of St. Paul’s and Greenwich. This
means that the great majority of his vast bulk of
achievement was done within about thirty years.</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that some of his churches show
signs of haste and want of thought? Can we suppose
anything but that some of them were left
largely to assistants?</p>

<p>The year of his first marriage was his <i>annus mirabilis</i>,
for during 1669 he must have been working
on the plans for the seventeen churches which
began to be built in 1670, and he was developing
the design of St. Paul’s at the same time.</p>

<p>Evelyn’s word <i>prodigious</i> seems to meet the case.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the towers and spires<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
as showing Wren’s sure touch as a tower-planner,
but the amazing variety of their treatment is notable
evidence of Wren being, <i>par excellence</i>, the architect
of adventure. As I wrote many years ago in a detailed
examination<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of the leaded spires, “he created
within the square mile of the city more forms of
steeples than all the architects of the Middle Ages,
and if, as was inevitable, some pay the penalty
of rash experiment, others made an assured success.”
Twenty-eight of the towers are crowned with either
spire or lantern, nine of stone, and nineteen of leaded
timber. Some are true spires, others spire-form
steeples, and the rest lanterns: this classification
is loose and arbitrary, but “Wren’s masterful way
of playing with architectural elements and combining
them in astonishing ways makes havoc of
any orderly description.”</p>

<p>The preponderance of leaded spires may be
attributed partly to his affection for the most characteristic
English metal—he chose it for St. Paul’s
dome after considering copper—and partly to their
cheapness as compared with stone.</p>

<p class="caption">S<small><sup>T</sup></small> MAGNUS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>St. Swithin’s Cannon Street has a spire of
Gothic type, and Wren stepped from the square of
the tower to the octagon of the spire by trimming
the tower angles to a splay, a short cut no mediæval
builder would have employed. At St. Margaret’s
Pattens Rood Lane, the tower finishes normally
with pinnacles at the corners, and the spire, instead
of being leaded with vertical rolls as at St. Swithin’s,
is treated with a series of sunk panels, a beautiful
and ingenious method: St. Margaret’s spire is indeed
a faultless work. Wren did nothing in stone to
match the form of these two. Exquisite in its
delicacy is the leaded needle spire of St. Martin
Ludgate, set on an arcaded lantern which grows in
turn out of an ogee roof, and the latter break is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
marked by a railed balcony. Obelisks take the
place of a spire at St. Margaret Lothbury, a steeple
of miraculous simplicity, and at St. Mildred’s
Bread Street. The tower of St. Lawrence Jewry
is crowned by a more massive composition, and the
outline of St. Augustine’s Watling Street is a little
uncertain. At St. Benet Paul’s Wharf the combination
of dome and lantern is perfect in its little
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>Amongst the stone steeples St. Mary-le-Bow and
St. Bride’s Fleet Street will always have champions
to argue which is the greater. Bow Tower has a
romantic, almost Jacobean, quality which contrasts
strongly with the austere outline of St. Bride’s.
It may be significant of a special importance attached
to it by Wren that it is the only tower which has a
bill of account, separate from that of the church,
in the full priced accounts which I have dealt with
in detail elsewhere. It cost £7,388 and the church
£8,071, whereas St. Bride’s altogether accounted only
for £11,430.</p>

<p class="caption">S<small><sup>T</sup></small> BRIDE’S</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>The question of the money spent on the City
churches is of considerable interest. The total
paid out was £263,786 10s. 4½d., and the amounts
entered up against each church were corrected to
farthings. These figures exclude most of the
internal fittings, which must have been the gift of
pious parishioners. The MS. accounts in the
Bodleian are abstracted in my <i>Archæologia</i> paper,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
and give the names of every mason, bricklayer,
plumber, painter, etc., employed, with the amounts
he (or sometimes she) received. I transcribed the
complete bills for St. Mary-le-Bow with Bow Tower
and for St. Stephen’s Walbrook. The latter cost
£7,652 13s. 8d., and only six churches exceeded that
sum. In some ways it is the most notable of them
all, for Wren contrived to give the effect of nave,
aisles and crossing to a plain room by his ingenuity
in carrying a circular dome on eight arches which
rest on an entablature supported by twelve columns.
East of the dome is one groined bay, and west of it
two groined bays divided by four more columns:
the side aisles have flat ceilings. The plan is
thus an oblong room with sixteen free columns,
but so cleverly disposed as to produce the variety
of effect described above. Sir Reginald Blomfield
justly says of the details that they are “coarse
and irrelevant,” but the interior is a masterpiece
of scenic planning, and the dome a not unworthy
trial piece for what followed at St. Paul’s. A
melancholy remodelling in 1847-8, the plans of
which are preserved at the R.I.B.A., destroyed
some of the character of the church, but the accompanying
illustration shows it in the “unimproved”
state as Wren left it.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>St. Lawrence Jewry is another of the churches
in which the architect was not pinched for funds.
It cost £11,870, but is on a somewhat uninteresting
plan—oblong, with an aisle on one side only. Here,
as in almost every church he built, Wren was a
determined economist of space, and with good reason.
About eighty churches had been destroyed in the
Fire, only fifty were rebuilt, and every sitting was
of importance. So he did not square up his building
if the site was irregular, but made the best,
usually a very ingenious best, of whatever odd
shape he had to cover in. And there was another
consideration. It is obvious from the sums paid for
many of the churches, as well as from the evidence
of the fabrics, that Wren did not pull down an old
wall if he could mend it and save it. There is,
therefore, all the more reason to respect these City
churches, which retain so much history in their
walls, going back even to the earliest times. Always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
practical and always an opportunist of the right sort,
he made the best job he could with the materials
and money he had at disposal. A more general
realisation of this would prevent criticism of details,
which ought to be addressed rather to parsimonious
clients than to the architect. Sometimes, however,
he made a brilliant excursion to meet the needs of
an odd-shaped site as at St. Benet Fink, which
he planned as a decagon. This enchanting church
stood behind the Royal Exchange and had a beautiful
little dome and lantern on its tower: the late
Mr. Peabody now sits in bronze on the site. At St.
Antholin’s, a church in Watling Street, with a
superb stone tower and spire, all swept away in
circumstances of infamy, he got over a swerve in the
street alinement by splaying the plan at the west
end. At St. Mary Abchurch and St. Swithin’s,
he had short, broad, and slightly irregular sites to
deal with, and covered in a square with a dome and
let the rest work out as it would. St. Mildred
Bread Street is a longer oblong which Wren treated
very delightfully by covering the middle with a
dome and the ends with round arches. The need to
house large congregations led him to provide galleries
at Christ Church Newgate Street, St. James
Piccadilly, St. Bride’s, St. Andrew-in-the-Wardrobe,
and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Wren’s outlook on the whole problem of parish-church
design was indicated with his usual clarity
in a letter which he wrote to guide his fellow Commissioners
in the task of building fifty new churches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
in Queen Anne’s reign. Written when he was
nearing eighty, the letter sums up the experience of
an amazing lifetime of church building.</p>

<p>He is strongly against burials in churches and
commends the idea of cemeteries on the outskirts of
the towns which will “bound the excessive growth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
of the City with a graceful border, which is now
encircled with scavengers’ dung stalls.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_092">

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">S<small><sup>T</sup></small> BRIDE’S</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the siting of churches, Wren is against too nice
an observation of “east and west in the position,
unless it falls out properly,” and wants to see them
brought as forward as possible into the larger and
more open streets. “Such fronts as shall happen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
to lie most open to view should be adorned with
porticoes, both for beauty and convenience; which
together with handsome spires or lanterns rising in
good proportion above the neighbouring houses (of
which I have given several examples in the City of
different forms) may be of sufficient ornament
to the town, without a great expense for enriching
the outward walls of the churches, in which plainness
and duration ought principally, if not wholly,
to be studied....”</p>

<p>A long paragraph is devoted to the question of
materials. He complains bitterly of the badness
of the available bricks, despite the fact that London
earth will yield a brick more durable than “any stone
our island affords.”</p>

<p>Wren is all for Portland-stone for windows and
doors, and likes oak for roofs “because it will bear
some negligence. The churchwardens’ care may
be defective in speedy mending drips: they usually
whitewash the church, and set up their names,
but neglect to preserve the roof over their heads.”</p>

<p>There is an oddly topical flavour in the note that
“the wars in the North Sea make timber at present
of excessive price,” and a prophecy of Imperial
trading in: “I suppose, ere long, we must have
recourse to the West Indies, where most excellent
timber may be had for cutting and fetching.”</p>

<p>As to roof coverings, “our tiles are ill-made and
our slates not good: lead is certainly the best and
lightest covering, and being of our own growth and
manufacture, and lasting, if properly made, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
many hundred years, is, without question, the most
preferable; though I will not deny but an excellent
tile may be made to be very durable: our artisans
are not yet instructed in it, and it is not soon done
to inform them....” If the Gothic Revivalists
had worked on Wren’s lines, the Church would not
now be saddled with a legacy of badly built Kentish
rag and rubble churches and spires, thinly roofed
with Welsh slates, an endless anxiety to parishes
unable to find money to remedy original defects of
construction.</p>

<p>Wren’s next point is of the essence of the problem
which he was facing, how to provide the accommodation
required for the people.</p>

<p>Even if the new fifty churches were to hold 2,000
apiece, there would not be room enough. “The
churches, therefore, must be large, but still, in our
reformed religion, it should seem vain to make a
parish church larger than that all who are present
can both hear and see. The Romanists, indeed,
may build larger churches; it is enough if they
hear the murmur of the Mass, and see the elevation
of the Host; but ours are to be fitted for auditories.”
Wren then quotes his St. James’s Piccadilly as
the most practicable model of “a single room so
capacious, with pews and galleries, as to hold above
2,000 persons, and all to hear the service and both
to hear distinctly and see the preacher.” He
claims for St. James’s that it is a beautiful and convenient
form, with “no walls of a second order,
nor lanterns nor buttresses, but the whole roof rests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
upon the pillars, as do also the galleries ... the
cheapest of any form I could invent.” St. James’s
Piccadilly cost £8,500, so its accommodation for
2,000 persons worked out at £4 5s. a seat. This
church is really in the line of development of the
old English timber Hall so far as its constructive
idea is concerned. It lent itself to the passing
need of galleries, but they are not essential to the
idea, as is sometimes supposed.</p>

<p>In discussing the place for the pulpit Wren has
some shrewd things to say about the enunciation
of English parsons, which hold good to-day: “A
Frenchman is heard further than an English preacher
because he raises his voice and sinks not his last
words ... an insufferable fault in the pronunciation
of some of our otherwise excellent preachers.”
Wren would have appreciated the similar advice of
a modern bishop to a class of candidates for ordination,
that they should not drop their voices at the
end of a sentence “lest the congregation might
suppose, <i>however erroneously</i>, that they had lost
something.” On the vexed question of seating the
people, our architect has some shrewd words:
“A church should not be so filled with pews, but that
the poor may have room enough to stand and sit in
the alleys: <i>for to them equally is the Gospel preached</i>.”</p>

<p>We may guess that Wren would have been all
for the rush-bottomed chair if it had been invented
in his day: “It were to be wished there were to be no
pews, but benches: but there is no stemming the
tide of profit, and the advantage of pew-keepers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>I have quoted at length from this letter in order
to mark the massive common sense which Wren
brought to the solution of his problems. Mr.
Arthur Bolton gives me the interesting parallel of
1818, when Sir John Soane reported to the Government
on the national church building scheme.
His recommendations show that he worked on his
great predecessor’s report and he even sent to St.
James’s and measured it as a typical instance. As,
however, the year 1818 preferred numbers to quality,
the results fell far below those of the earlier century.</p>

<p>It was Wren’s quality of common sense as much
as the genius of the artist that made his City
churches what they are, practical solutions of practical
difficulties and instinct with the English spirit
of compromise, but none the less the greatest group
of churches created in any country by the genius and
practical wisdom of one man.</p>

<small>CHELSEA, HAMPTON COURT, AND GREENWICH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Basil Champneys</span> has recorded a notable
observation by Thomas Carlyle on Chelsea Hospital:
“I had passed it, almost daily, for many years
without thinking much about it, and one day I
began to reflect that it had always been a pleasure
to me to see it, and I looked at it more attentively,
and saw that it was quiet and dignified and <i>the
work of a gentleman</i>.” This was evidently a favourite
theme with Carlyle, for William Allingham’s
Diary for June 25, 1874, records a similar phrase
with the addition that the Hospital was “admirably
adapted for its uses.” Carlyle’s devotion to Wren’s
memory had an odd repercussion. When William
De Morgan called on the Sage to beg him on behalf
of William Morris to join the Anti-Scrape Society,
Carlyle was cold at first, but a reference to the
dealings of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners with
Wren’s churches set him alight. He ended a panegyric
on Wren with “he was a very great man, of
extraordinary patience with fools,” and glared
round at the company reproachfully. Morris rather
winced when Carlyle, in a letter accepting membership
of the Anti-Scrape, referred to the City churches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
as “marvellous works, the like of which we shall
never see again,” and his hatred of the Renaissance
never ceased to blind him to Wren’s genius.</p>

<p>It would have been well if the Society had been
more active, in the past, in defence of Wren’s
churches. The narrow mediævalism of the latter
half of the nineteenth century wrought havoc even
where it failed to destroy. Stained glass and other
alien trappings have prejudiced far too many of
his fine interiors. One church architect of the type
responsible for these things was finely reproved
with the reminder that Wren was just as good a
High Churchman as he was.</p>

<p>The site of Chelsea Hospital had been given by
the King to the Royal Society soon after its foundation,
but it was an inconvenient possession, and the
Society sold it back to the King for the foundation
of a Royal Hospital for disabled soldiers. Sir Stephen
Fox, a retired army contractor, supplemented the
King’s benefactions, and on May 25, 1682, the
inevitable Evelyn went with Fox and Wren to
Lambeth to secure the Archbishop of Canterbury’s
approval to the plot and design or, as we should say,
plan and elevations. Ten weeks later Evelyn was
at Chelsea with Fox to see the foundations started.
Wren was a good deal more than architect to the
Hospital. It was during his Presidency of the
Royal Society that the land was re-conveyed to
the King: he carried the business through with
characteristic despatch, and the statutes governing
the charity were of his drafting. The buildings were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
completed in 1692, and no better praise of them
than Carlyle’s can be invented. Wren shows himself
in one of his characteristic moods as a sane economist
where the purpose of the building makes economy
an æsthetic as well as a practical virtue. The
Hospital is a liberal education in the handling of
London brickwork. When Sir John Soane, in
the days of Nash stucco, had to add an Infirmary
building, he was careful to design in brick and
content to despise the abuse it evoked at that
time. At Hampton Court Wren had a very
different problem: he was housing not pensioners
but a King and Queen. His original scheme
had a quality of immensity. Our Dutch monarch
who had so successfully countered the statesmanship
of Louis XIV. doubtless wanted to follow, at
some distance, his building exploits at Versailles
and elsewhere. Queen Mary had a great liking for
the situation of Hampton Court. Wren was bidden
to prepare a scheme for a complete rebuilding and
did so. Part of the old fabric was taken down
and Wren’s two great suites of apartments for King
and Queen rose in its place. The work went forward
vigorously from 1689 to 1694, and then the
Queen’s death caused the completion of the plan
to be abandoned. The execution of the partial
scheme drifted on until 1700. There was a chance
then of the King proceeding to the finishing of the
complete plan, but William’s death finally killed it.
To these accidents of mortality we owe it that part
of Wolsey’s palace has remained. If Wren had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
had his way, not a brick of the Tudors would have
survived. The architect was happy in only one of
his royal clients. Mary was amiable and reasonable,
but William’s temper and his habit of interference
tried Wren very high. The King, however, was
fair enough to say that the insufficient headroom
of the cloisters must be ascribed to his express
orders which overbore Wren’s wishes.</p>

<p>Despite this, the Fountain Court is one of the
successful features of the Palace, which reveals
Wren’s sanity and dignity and Englishness in a
most convincing way. It is enough to look at
Chatsworth, in the light of Hampton Court, to
realize the difference between pedantry and genius.
Norman Shaw so greatly admired Hampton Court,
that he would have followed it in Whitehall, if he
had been entrusted with the Government offices.
The weakest part of the Palace is the pedimented
garden front, where a sense of display, due perhaps
to Royal Command, contrasts with the greater
simplicity of the return façade towards the Tudor
garden.</p>

</figure>

<p>Hampton Court, for all its size, is a gentleman’s
house rather than a palace, and Wren’s treatment of
the smaller rooms fills a marked place in the development
of the English interior. Left more to himself,
Wren would have been more English in the height
of his rooms. He had a sense of fitness which is of
the essence of good architecture. Wren was unlucky
at Hampton Court in more than in one of his clients.
His Comptroller (or, as we should say, Clerk) of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Works was William Talman, who accused him of
having passed bad work. Some masonry showed
cracks, and enough stir was created to lead the
House of Lords to order an enquiry. Wren was
exonerated, and with characteristic generosity he
did not call, as he might well have done, for the
dismissal of a disloyal assistant. Time has revenged
him. Chatsworth shows Talman to have been a
heavy-handed fellow, but he is also remembered as
a bad colleague in other things than the Hampton
Court accusation. If visitors to the Palace should
feel that Wren failed in giving a suitable approach to
the State apartments, they should remember that they
are in the presence of an incomplete scheme, and that
he left a design of notable splendour for wings with
colonnades at the north side. The incidental furnishings
of avenues took shape in the chestnuts of Bushey
Park, but the rest remained on paper. In one detail
of the gardens Wren must have taken special pleasure.
The marvellous iron screens by Tijou have been moved
from their original position, but they remain to show
Wren’s skill in the choice of his craftsmen.</p>

<p>The third of his great secular buildings, Greenwich
Hospital, had the same charitable purpose as
Chelsea, but exceeded Hampton Court in magnificence.
Charles I. had employed Inigo Jones to
build, at some distance from the Thames, a house
for his Queen, Henrietta Maria. Soon after the
accession of Charles II., John Webb, as ghost for
Sir John Denham, had begun the great building
by the shore for which Inigo Jones may have left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
designs; but money ran short and work was suspended
after only a small part had been done. This
wing is on well-known Palladian lines, but is hampered
by a heavy attic, so ill-adjusted as to discredit
whoever was responsible for it. When William
and Mary succeeded James II., the Queen wished
to emulate her uncle Charles in making provision
for disabled seamen as he had done for soldiers.
Once more Wren and Evelyn were to be colleagues.
On May 5, 1695, the Royal Commission, consisting
of these two, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and
other bigwigs, had its first meeting at the London
Guildhall, and sixteen days later the two friends and
three others went, as a Committee, to survey the
site. Evelyn’s task was to raise subscriptions, and
he made an interesting choice of a secretary in
Mr. Vanbrugh, afterwards Sir John. About a year
was spent in preparing plans, and on June 4, 1696,
the Committee met at Wren’s house in Whitehall
to make agreements for materials and workmen and
to give orders for the foundations to be begun. On
the last day of June a select committee of thirteen
dined together at Greenwich, and precisely at five
o’clock (Mr. Flamsteed, the King’s Astronomer,
“observing the punctual time by instruments”)
Wren and Evelyn jointly laid the foundation stone.</p>

</figure>

<p>Queen Mary wanted the old Queen’s House and
the Charles II. wing to be integral parts of the
new scheme—a rather hampering condition. Wren
took the former as the closing feature of a vista
from the river, between his two new blocks named<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
after William and Mary and his Queen Anne block,
which balances and exactly follows the Jones-Webb
block of Charles II.</p>

<p>Wren’s contribution to Greenwich was, therefore,
the two superb quadrangular blocks with open sides
adorned with colonnades and the big idea of planning
which pulled together the work of four reigns into a
coherent and superb whole. The duality of the
domes is a most notable feature, and their individual
design is beautifully differentiated from the grander
scale of St. Paul’s. They are domestic, rather than
church-like, in conception. That Hawksmoor in
his capacity as Deputy-Surveyor had a somewhat
free hand in designing part of the work after 1705,
that Vanbrugh succeeded Wren as Surveyor in
1716, that Colin Campbell took up the task ten
years later, and that Ripley superseded him in
1729, does not deprive Wren of the title of architect
of the Hospital. In so far as they departed from
his original designs the buildings suffered, especially
from the baldness of the Campbell elements and
the heavy-handedness of the ex-carpenter Ripley.
Wren’s planning, his domes and his colonnades,
make Greenwich the noblest of English public
buildings in the Grand Manner.</p>

<p>The view of the Palace from the Thames is
magnificent and has been an inspiration to artists
ever since. Abroad, it would be an objective to
all travellers.</p>

<small>OTHER BUILDINGS: PUBLIC AND DOMESTIC</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> volume has no claim to be a biography of
Wren: still less is it a <i>catalogue raisonné</i> of his
buildings. Familiar students of his work will be
merciful if they find a bare reference, or none, to
something they may regard as peculiarly satisfying
and notably Wrennish. I can but plead the limitations
of a little book. But some of his buildings
not included in earlier chapters must be at least
mentioned, if shortly and in a disjointed list.</p>

<p>Amongst public works the Monument takes a
prominent if rather unsatisfactory place. The
design was subjected to a good deal of interference,
for Hawksmoor records that the flaming urn was
substituted as a crowning feature for the intended
statue of Charles <i>contra architecti intentionem</i>.</p>

<p>Amongst the pedestals of equestrian statues in
London, there is none to compare with that of
Charles I. at Charing Cross, which was probably
of Wren’s designing, but it has been attributed also
to Grinling Gibbons.</p>

<p>Temple Bar was an interesting archway which now
adorns Theobald’s Park and is commemorated on
its old site in Fleet Street by a melancholy monument.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
There seems a good case for the return of
Temple Bar to some site in London. The neighbouring
entrance to the Middle Temple is one of
Wren’s most charming achievements. His use
of brickwork here in conjunction with a stone
base and pilasters is of an ideal modesty and
simplicity, matched within the Temple by the
cloister of Hare Court and rubbed brick doorways
in King’s Bench Walk. Of these works as
of Kensington Palace Coventry Patmore’s words
were abundantly true: “Sir Christopher Wren
could not build a common brick house without
impressing his own character upon it.” He might
have added that it needs a considerable artist to
give character to a common brick house, for the
palette is limited. Wren’s work at Kensington has
been a good deal modified by later hands, but
the Queen’s staircase and the Gallery remain very
typical. The exterior suffers greatly from the clumsy
additions of William Kent, which are too often accepted
as part of the original house. The lay-out
should be restored, and the great alcove be brought
back from its present stupid position near the fountain.
The Orangery is a masterpiece of simplicity and
reserve, and shows Wren exercising the consummate
taste which cannot in honesty be regarded as a
continuous characteristic. The attribution of various
houses to Wren rests either upon vague tradition
or upon imaginary internal evidence. The belief
that he designed Belton is persistent but unsupported
by documents. The notable contributions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
made to its decoration by Grinling Gibbons
may have strengthened the tradition. Certainly
Belton is worthy of Wren. The same may be said
of two houses in Chichester, Pallant House and
another which has long been called Wren’s House.
Miss Milman in her <i>Life</i> printed a chronological list
of works, and starred those for which there was no
documentary authority. But her stars must be
increased. The Chichester houses are cases in
point.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that Marlborough House has
been so mishandled since Wren’s day: the attic
storey is a clumsy addition. As he planned it,
the disposition of the rooms showed no advance
on the planning of Inigo Jones and Webb. The
main rooms were <i>en suite</i> without any corridor
behind them, a march of convenience which Vanbrugh
developed at Blenheim, not otherwise a
mirror of perfection. Sarah, Duchess, must have
been a client calling for all Wren’s skill in handling
people. When she quarrelled with Vanbrugh about
his fees for Blenheim, she quoted Wren as a pattern
of moderation “content to be dragged up in a basket,
three or four times a week, to the top of St. Paul’s,
and at great hazard, for £200 a year.”</p>

<p>Groombridge Place, Kent, is another house of
infinite charm which has been attributed to Wren.
The All Souls Collection of his drawings includes
some sketch elevations of houses. One sheet in
particular gives two alternative treatments for the
same plan, but neither is up to Wren’s best form,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
and it seems reasonable to assume that the smaller
domestic work for private clients had to be ignored
in the main because of his heavy public employments.
Amongst his works which have disappeared
altogether are the Custom House, the Armoury and
Mint in the Tower of London (where his Storehouse
has survived), Christ’s Hospital, and the College of
Physicians in Warwick Lane.</p>

<p>Not the least interesting of an architect’s designs
are those which are never carried to full fruition.
The most notable of these was a great Palace at
Winchester, begun for Charles II. Not much of
it was built, for the King died before it was finished,
and his successors did not like Winchester. The
uncompleted core was later adapted so drastically
for use as barracks that it ceased to have any Wren
significance.</p>

<p>The Tomb of Charles I., for which Parliament
voted £70,000, was designed by Wren in 1678.
The drawings preserved at All Souls show a domed
structure, which was to have stood at the east end
of St. George’s Chapel, Windsor. Within was to be
a statue of the Martyr King standing on a shield
upheld by four allegorical figures. Alternative
treatments are shown for this group in marble and
bronze. Grinling Gibbons would no doubt have
been the sculptor, but, as Wren’s title of the drawings
notes, it was <i>eheu conditionem temporum, nondum
extructum</i>. The <i>nondum</i> gives a hint that Wren
hoped that it might later be done, but the £70,000
found less worthy employment. Wren’s careful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
detailed estimates for the work are printed in Sir
William St. John Hope’s monumental <i>Windsor
Castle</i>, with reproductions of the drawings.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe41_9375" id="plate12">

<figcaption class="caption">
<p class="caption">TRINITY COLLEGE LIBRARY, CAMBRIDGE: RIVER FRONT.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Noble as this design was, I confess I take more
pleasure from Wren’s design for a monument (also
in All Souls Library) which Sir Reginald Blomfield
reproduces<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> with the note that it was probably
drawn by Grinling Gibbons. It shows a lady
reclining on a couch, not unlike Raggi’s Lady
Cheyne in Chelsea Old Church, but she points with
a lively gesture to cherubs flying above her in a
burst of rays and clouds. It shows Wren in his
most baroque mood, and is perhaps his reminiscence
of old Bernini’s monumental manner.</p>

<p>In Scotland he did nothing; but the Royal Hospital
at Kilmainham, near Dublin, is attributed to
him with some reason. In 1679 he was ordered to
view the site, but no record remains of his visit,
and this Irish variant of Chelsea Hospital is not
claimed by his son in the list of works. The building
is simple and dignified with open cloisters round a
big quadrangle. Probably Wren did designs for
it and left some assistant or local architect to supervise
its building. The best evidence for his authorship
is that there was no architect in Ireland who
could have produced such a design, with the possible
exception of the designer of Beaulieu, near
Drogheda.</p>

<p>Another charitable foundation, Morden College,
Blackheath, is certainly Wren’s. It is an enchanting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
piece of brickwork with a pedimented centre-piece
and lantern.</p>

<p>As Cambridge was the locus of his first <i>completed</i>
work of importance, Pembroke Chapel (the Sheldonian
is called in the <i>Parentalia</i> “the first publick
Performance of the Surveyor,” but it was finished
later than the chapel); it also gave him the opportunity
for one of his greatest achievements, the
Library of Trinity. His first design was for a
circular building with a domed roof, but this soon
gave place to the scheme that was carried out.
A long memorandum by Wren explains his reasons
for the design, which was limited by the need of
joining the new Library to the extension of Neville’s
Court, a junction which was not very happily
achieved. The governing consideration of the
elevation to the Court was the maintenance of the
Library floor on the same level as the adjoining
chambers. Unfortunately Wren would use two
Orders despite the fact that the structure of the work
was in conflict. Evidently he was forcing a design,
naturally of a Palladian type, of a <i>piano nobile</i>
on a lower storey which would be the podium of
an Order. It is a case where his ingenuity overbore
his artistic sense, and he resorted to the doubtful
expedient of a range of arches, the tympana of
which are filled in solid. The river front has been
criticised on the grounds of an undue austerity,
but I find it difficult to follow this: it is surely
a miracle of dignity. For the interior of the
Library there can be nothing but praise. Ideal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
in dignity and ideal in convenience, Wren’s book
presses have the additional merit of showing Gibbons
carving of peculiar excellence, and he must not be
charged with the overcrowding of the floor by smaller
cases needed by modern accessions of books.</p>

<p>Wren was less happy in his chapel and cloister
at Emmanuel College. The breaking of the pediment
of the central feature by the lantern turret
is not in his usual vein, but the lantern itself is a
very charming composition. Another related work
is the Honywood Library and Cloister at Lincoln
Cathedral, but the Library itself is a rather low and
not specially distinguished apartment.</p>

<p>I bring this slight catalogue of Wren’s miscellaneous
works to a close with a return to Oxford.
It is difficult to determine how far he was responsible
for the Library at Queen’s College (1693) because
Hawksmoor was mixed up with him there, but the
whole College must be regarded as a Wren building.
There is nothing of Hawksmoor’s more faithful to
his old master’s ideas, and less influenced by Sir
John Vanbrugh’s, the two poles between which the
lesser man was always oscillating. Sir Reginald
Blomfield is strongly against attributing the Ashmolean
to Wren, but it is difficult to believe that
such a building at such a time could have been
entrusted to anyone else. Similarly Trinity College
Chapel (1694) is somewhat of a mystery. It has
been said that Dean Aldrich was the architect
and that Wren was only called in to advise. The
quality of the design suggests that Wren was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
the senior partner in the combination. There is no
confusion with regard to Tom Tower. Dr. Fell,
Dean of Christ Church, commissioned him to build
a tower over Wolsey’s gateway. The result is
something certainly not Tudor, but quite certainly
a picturesque composition of a high order. Wren’s
detail is little like that of the sixteenth century
below it, but he did the one thing needful: he provided
a dignified and picturesque portal for the
College, and it is folly to rebuke a late seventeenth-century
architect for not entering into the spirit of
his predecessors of the early sixteenth. The study
of the spirit of Gothic work, alike systematic and
sympathetic, is a growth of less than a hundred
years. Wren was of his age.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>WREN AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES: LAST
YEARS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> appreciation a man may win in his own day
and generation is no sure guide to his quality as an
artist, as witness the cases of Mr. Martin Tupper
and many Past Presidents of the Royal Academy;
but when the chorus of praise persists during something
like eighty years and comes from men in
every walk of life, it is at least evidence of notable
character. Such praise was Wren’s in a marked
degree, and it helps to explain the way he held his
own under the fickle King Charles, the cantankerous
King William, and the casual Queen Anne.
Under King George I., when Wren was a very old
man, he lost his appointment, but only as the culmination
of a discreditable campaign against him
by futile people who lacked the wit to appreciate
the greatness of the man against whom they plotted
their dishonest little persecutions.</p>

<p>In so far as Wren’s advancement as an architect
may be attributed to any one man, it is clear that
John Evelyn the diarist must have the credit.
Whether he met Wren before 1654 does not appear;
but he was in Oxford on July 11 of that year,
Wren being then twenty-two years old, and after
dinner he visited “that miracle of a youth,” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
had further dealings with him two days later, as
is noted in an earlier chapter. By 1664, when Wren
showed Evelyn the model of the Sheldonian, he
had become “that incomparable genius,” and
Evelyn went to Oxford in 1669 for the celebrations
which marked the completion of the theatre.</p>

<p>Wren’s appointment as Surveyor-General of His
Majesty’s Works was due to Evelyn’s great influence
with Charles II., to whom he seems to have acted
in some sort as an architectural adviser.</p>

<p>How greatly Evelyn valued Wren’s judgment in
ordinary matters is shown by a letter in 1665 in
which the diarist asks Wren to recommend a tutor
for his boy. In the same letter Evelyn mentions
his translation of Fréart’s <i>Parallels</i>, a book on
architecture which had been very successful in
France and sold very largely in England in Evelyn’s
edition. The first issue was dedicated to Sir John
Denham, but it is interesting to find that in
February, 1696-7, Evelyn wrote to Wren saying
that he would dedicate to him the new edition he
was then producing, and so he did with many
flourishes.</p>

<p>There is a characteristic outburst in the <i>Diary</i>
for May 5, 1681, when Sir W. Fermor dined with
him and Wren: “A wonderful genius had this incomparable
person,” an echo of what he had written
seventeen years before when Wren showed him the
model of the Sheldonian—“that incomparable
genius.”</p>

<p>The last Wren entry in the <i>Diary</i> was forty-four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
years later than the first. Wren went down to Says
Court with “Mr. London, his gardener,” to render
Evelyn the service of estimating the damage done
to the house and gardens during its occupation by
Peter the Great, who had comported himself in a
manner which justly disgusted Evelyn. Wren
outlived his old and faithful friend by more than
twenty years.</p>

Verrio and Kneller.”</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Although a quiet, modest, and always overworked
person, Wren seems to have liked social
relaxation. He was at Lord Brouncker’s in February,
1666-7, with Samuel Pepys, who refers
to the music that their host had provided. There
were two eunuchs, so tall as to move Sir T. Harvey
to some physiological imaginings, and one woman
“very well dressed and handsome enough, but
would not be kissed,” at least so Mr. Killigrew informed
Mr. Pepys. Not long afterwards Pepys
met Wren at Streeter’s, “with several virtuosos,”
looking at the paintings which were being made for
the new theatre at Oxford. It must have been a
pleasant occasion on February 9, 1671, when Wren
and Pepys dined with Evelyn at Says Court, and
all of them went afterwards to see the “Crucifixion”
which Grinling Gibbons had carved. A few weeks
later the King and Queen indicated their wish to
see this work, at Evelyn’s suggestion, and it was
taken to Whitehall for their inspection. Evelyn
records the anger he felt at the Queen ignoring the
merits of the wonderful carving because a “French
pedling woman” had run it down, but he had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
compensation that “Mr. Wren faithfully promised
me to employ him.” How faithfully that promise
was fulfilled is proved by the choir stalls of St.
Paul’s and work at many another Wren building.</p>

<p>In February, 1676, Evelyn and Wren, with other
notable Fellows of the Royal Society, dined with Sir
John Williamson, and in November in the following
year the same inseparable friends dined in the
company of Prince Rupert and other learned men
at the Lord Treasurer’s. Wren had achieved that
useful measure of friendship with Prince Rupert
which caused his name to figure on a list of intimates
to whom the Prince sent every year a gift of choicest
wine from his estates on the Rhine.</p>

<p>In August, 1680, Evelyn was deputed by the
Royal Society to make a visit of ceremony to Monsieur
Chardine, a famous French traveller who had
come to London, and characteristically he took
Wren with him.</p>

<p>Wren must have been good company at dinner.
In 1669 Sir John Clayton wrote to a friend: “Saturday
last I went with the Duke of Buckingham to
Denham ... on our return home we dined at
Uxbridge, and never in all my life did I pass my day
away with such gusto, our company being his Grace,
Mr. Weller, Mr. Surveyor Wren and myself: nothing
but quintessence of wit and most excellent discourse.”</p>

<p>As to whether Wren enjoyed wide hospitalities
in his alleged character of Freemason it is impossible
to say, but there is a tradition that he was Grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
Master of a lodge which was intimately associated
with St. Paul’s and became in due time what is
known as the Antiquity Lodge. Some candlesticks,
and a mallet bearing an inscription which
suggests that it was used at a St. Paul’s ceremonial,
remain in possession of the Antiquity Lodge. It is
necessary, however, to add that Gould in his <i>History
of Freemasonry</i> gives it as his opinion, after careful
investigation of the architect’s connection with the
craft, that the evidence points to Wren not having
belonged to a lodge, nor to a society which was not
in existence until 1717, and he goes on to allege that
there are three misstatements on the mallet inscription.
I have no knowledge of these matters, but
assume that Gould’s opinion is competent. There
is no reference to Freemasonry in any Wren document
or in <i>Parentalia</i>, but so far as the latter is
concerned the omission means nothing.</p>

<p>I have indicated very slightly, and with the
diffidence of one who knows nothing of science but
a few of its fairy tales, the large range of Wren’s
scientific labours. It may be that they were curious
rather than important, but it is necessary to set
down the considered opinion of Dr. Sprat, the first
historian of the Royal Society. It is a notable
tribute:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the whole progress of this narration, I have
been cautious to forbear commending the labours of
any Private Fellows of the Society. For this, I
need not make any apology to them; feeling it
would have been an inconsiderable honour, to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
praised by so mean a writer: But now I must break
this law, in the particular case of Dr. Christopher
Wren: For doing so, I will not alledge the excuse
of my friendship to him; though that perhaps were
sufficient; and it might well be allowed me to take
this occasion of Publishing it: But I only do it on
the mere consideration of justice: For in turning
over the Registers of the Society, I perceived that
many excellent things, whose first invention ought
to be ascribed to him, were casually omitted: This
moves me to do him right by himself, and to give
this separate account of his endeavours, in promoting
the design of the Royal Society, in the
small time wherein he has had the opportunity of
attending it.”</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Sprat then recites some of Wren’s achievements
in the fields of natural science, astronomy,
etc., and continues thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This is a short account of the principal discoveries
which Dr. Wren has presented or suggested
to this assembly. I know very well, that some of
them he did only start and design; and that they
have been since carried on to perfection, by the
industry of other hands. I purpose not to rob them
of their share in the honour: Yet it is but reasonable,
that the original invention should be ascribed to
the true author, rather than the finishers. Nor do
I fear that this will be thought too much, which I
have said concerning him: For there is a peculiar
reverence due to so much excellence covered with
so much modesty. And it is not flattery but
honesty, to give him his just praise; who is so far
from usurping the fame of other men that he endeavours
with all care to conceal his own.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>A man could not ask a better epitaph than “so
much excellence covered with so much modesty.”</p>

<p>It may be that Sprat was carried away by his
affection for Wren and overstated the case, but
that amiable reason can hardly apply to all his contemporaries.
Robert Boyle, who had witnessed
some of Wren’s experiments, testified that his
knowledge of Wren’s extraordinary sagacity made
him very desirous to try what he proposed.</p>

<p>The evidence of Sir Isaac Newton cannot be
ignored. His Preface to the second edition of the
<i>Principia</i> groups Wren with Wallis and Huygens
as “hujus ætatis geometrarum facile principes,”
and gives to them the first credit for a true conception
of the laws governing the impacts and reactions
of two bodies in collision. Praise from Newton is
praise indeed.</p>

<p>Thomas Hearne carried it a little further. “I
heard an eminent mathematician say that he could
mention another equal in mathematics to Sir Isaac
Newton, <i>though he had not published</i> ... Sir
Christopher Wren, who was, indeed, a very extraordinary
man.”</p>

<p>When Isaac Barrow succeeded to the Gresham
Professorship of Geometry, he took occasion, in
his inaugural oration, to refer to Wren in this
fashion: “One there is, whose name common gratitude
forbids me to pass over, whom I know not
whether to admire for his divine genius or for the
sweetness of his disposition ... it will suffice if I
name the great and good Christopher Wren, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
whom I will say no more since his merit attracts the
eyes of the whole world” ... and so on, with the
inevitable references to Wren’s modesty.</p>

<p>In nothing did the sweetness of Wren’s nature
so clearly appear as in his relations with Robert
Hooke, a sour philosopher and, it would seem, a
disloyal fellow. Hooke was at Westminster just
before Wren and ran second to him all his life. If
Elmes’ view of the case be true, Hooke picked up
Wren’s ideas, developed them and tried to take all
the credit of them, and was a bad colleague generally.
He quarrelled with Newton, disputed with Flamsteed,
and was snubbed by the Royal Society when
he did a design, unasked, for their home which was
promptly rejected and Wren asked to do it instead.
He was always in hot water and incurably unpopular,
but Wren stuck to him. When an assistant
was needed in the great labours which followed the
Fire, Wren appointed Hooke to measure and set
out the ground of all the “private street houses,”
but was wise enough to keep the Public Works in
his own hands.</p>

<p>Wren was delightfully loyal to the contractors
whom he employed. He must have been on intimate
terms with Edward Strong, master mason
at St. Paul’s and elsewhere, for he sent young Christopher
abroad in charge of Strong’s son. He
gave the buildings he liked best to the few men he
most trusted. Strong and Christopher Kempster
did St. Stephen’s Walbrook; Strong did the delightful
brickwork at St. Benet Paul’s Wharf, St. Augustine’s,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
St. Mildred’s, and several others. On the
fifty churches only thirteen joiners and ten plasterers
received contracts. All the coppersmith
work, except at two churches, was done by one
Robert Bird. My publication of the accounts of
the City churches destroyed all manner of vain
fancies as to the employment of Dutch joiners and
Italian plasterers in their building. When Wren
found a good English workman he employed him
steadily, and only went to a foreigner like Tijou for
the miraculous ironwork at St. Paul’s, Hampton
Court, and elsewhere when he was a notable artist
and far superior to his English colleagues.</p>

</figure>

<p>As an example of the way Wren was trusted, it
is worth noting that when Flamsteed was bickering
by letter with Cassini, the French astronomer, and
accusing Halley of disingenuous practices and
praying God to make Halley sensible of his faults,
the peaceful Wren was called in as umpire.</p>

<p>I could wish that some Parliamentary contemporary
had put on record his impressions of Wren as
an M.P., an unlikely trade for a man of his temperament.
Elected for New Windsor in William’s first
Parliament, he was unseated on a technicality, but
immediately re-elected. In 1700 he was returned
for the Borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis,
but, as Elmes gravely observes, “notwithstanding
this additional occupation, he found time to write
a dissertation on the ascension of the sap in trees,
and a paper on the superfice of the terraqueous
globe.” Doubtless he found these employments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
prettier relaxations from architecture than attendance
at the House of Commons.</p>

<p>Wren seems to have got on well with Charles II.,
who knighted him at Whitehall on November 20,
1672.</p>

<p>Indeed, the King might well have been grateful
to the man who so notably gave lustre to his reign.
Wren stood to Charles in something the same relation
as Phidias to Pericles.</p>

<p>King William was an awkward client, and interfered
with Wren in the design of Hampton Court;
but Queen Mary liked to talk to him about architecture
and gardening, and to watch the progress of
the works “on which she often offered her own
judgment, which was allowed to be exquisite.”
For Wren’s sake, we hope it was.</p>

<p>Queen Anne was invoked by Wren to take a hand
in his quarrels with the Commissioners of St. Paul’s.
He had a shrewd dig at them in one formal petition
to Her Majesty, in which he was able to show that
they were making a mess of the railings round her
own statue, and throwing over Tijou’s design, as
approved by Wren, in favour of some model of their
own.</p>

<p>What action Anne took does not appear, but
then or at some time she gave Wren a delightful
chest of drawers, which remained an heirloom in the
Wren family until Mrs. Pigott’s death, and a
calendar watch that reposes in Sir John Soane’s
Museum with a walking-stick, which conceals
drawing instruments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>I have dealt with Wren’s dismissal from office in
the chapter on St. Paul’s. He was then in the
eighty-sixth year of his age and the forty-ninth of
his Surveyorship. The remainder of his life was
spent in retirement, “in which Recess, free from
worldly affairs, he passed the greatest part of the
five last following years of his life in contemplation
and studies and principally in the consolation of the
holy scriptures: cheerful in solitude and as well
pleased to die in the shade as in the light.”</p>

<p>The manner of Wren’s passing is told by Miss
Phillimore, and is, I imagine, a family tradition
derived from Mrs. Pigott:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Once a year it was his habit to be driven to
London, and to sit for a while under the dome of
his own Cathedral. On one of these journeys he
caught a cold and soon afterwards, on February 25,
1723, his servant, thinking Sir Christopher slept
longer after dinner than was his wont, came into
the room and found his master dead in his chair,
with an expression of perfect peace on the calm
features.”</p>
</div>

<p>So died a great artist, a great Christian, and a
great gentleman, who lived, as his epitaph says,
more than ninety years, not for himself, but for the
good of the State.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>THE PROFESSIONAL MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is of some interest to attempt to form a picture
of Wren, not as a great artist in building, but as a
professional architect dealing with clients who were
often awkward and sometimes dishonest, like the
St. Paul’s authorities in his later years, carrying
out a vast amount of detail work which is now
regarded as the task of the surveyor rather than the
architect, making arrangements for the settlement
of disputes, boundary lines, frontages, and for compliance
with Royal Proclamations and Acts of
Parliament, negotiating with clients as to fees, and
generally dealing with the financial and business
side of his profession.</p>

<p>All his biographers have emphasised the undoubted
fact that Wren was not a self-seeking man,
but I think they have a little overdone the suggestion
of altruism. It is said in <i>Parentalia</i> and elsewhere
that Wren’s salary of £200 a year for the
work of designing and superintending St. Paul’s
was a very modest sum. That is true, but it must
be remembered that the salary ran from 1675, when
he was appointed Surveyor-General and Architect
of St. Paul’s, until 1711, when the House of Commons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
determined that the Cathedral was completed.
He, therefore received £7,200 in respect of St.
Paul’s. It is also stated in <i>Parentalia</i> that he
received £100 a year for work on the City churches.
But this seems to be wholly untrue, for Wren was
paid on exactly the same basis as an architect of
to-day—<i>i.e.</i>, by a commission on the value of the
work executed. Until 1919, when it was raised to
6 per cent., the customary remuneration of an
architect in England was 5 per cent.; and a manuscript
account, covering the period from July, 1670,
to March, 1673, quoted by Wyatt Papworth, shows
that twelve-pence in the pound for all monies
received and paid was disbursed “for allowances
for rebuilding the Churches to the Officers of Works
for the management of the whole.” This is 5 per
cent., out of which Wren no doubt paid for his
office staff. As the total expenditure on the City
churches was £263,786, Wren must have received
over £13,000. In addition, the City authorities
would now and again give to him (or in one case
to Lady Wren) a lump sum by way of expressing
their gratitude for his services.</p>

<p>In the capacity of Surveyor-General of His
Majesty’s Works, he was receiving, in 1675, 13s. 2d.
a day and “availes” of £80 per quarter, which
meant another £320 a year, by way of retaining fee;
and Papworth presumes, I think with reason, that
he also received specific payment in respect of each
service performed. By the year 1715, his salary
and “riding charges” had dropped to £136 a year,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
but it is also to be remembered that all this time he
had an official residence in Whitehall consisting of
sixteen rooms and a cellar, which he occupied for
about fifty years without cost to himself.</p>

<p>In respect of Chelsea Hospital he received a fee
of £1,000, but there are many examples of his
refusing payment altogether. He insisted on doing
all the work at Greenwich Hospital without payment,
saying, “Let me have some share in an act of charity
and mercy.” When he came to design the Library
of Trinity at Cambridge, for which the Master had
some difficulty in getting enough subscriptions,
Wren’s contribution was the value of his own work,
for which he made no charge; and, similarly, he
received nothing in respect of his work at St.
Clement Danes. These are acts of generosity of
which we happen to have definite record, and I
do not doubt that there were many other examples
of the same sort not recorded, for Wren’s generosity
was equalled only by his modesty.</p>

<p>He was not above a trifling piece of nepotism;
for his son Christopher became Deputy Clerk Engrosser
in the Office of Works in 1694 and Clerk
of Works in 1702, succeeding Dickenson. This
appointment was confirmed by George I. in 1715.
But when Sir Christopher fell from favour his
son was also dismissed, and from the younger
Christopher’s casual proceedings in the compilation
of the material of <i>Parentalia</i>, I cannot believe that
the State suffered greatly from his disappearance.</p>

<p>During thirty-two years of Wren’s professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
career, Nicholas Hawksmoor was his domestic clerk,
which we may take to mean that he was in charge
of Wren’s office and his right-hand man, both in
designing and in the financial supervision of the
works. It would appear that he performed a good
many of the duties which now fall to the separate
profession of quantity surveyor. I suspect that,
for example, the payments to the various contractors
for the City churches, and possibly also
for St. Paul’s, were certified by Wren after the value
of the work done had been examined by Hawksmoor.
It seems certain that the very elaborate
accounts of the City churches, with which I have
dealt fully in <i>Archæologia</i>, were actually written out
by Hawksmoor himself.</p>

</figure>

<p>By Wren’s time, the practice of architecture had
been organised generally on lines which were developed
notably by the brothers Adam, very competent
business men, and have been elaborated in
very modern times. But substantially the methods
remain the same except that contracting has
equally been developed so that separate tradesmen
are now merged in a general contractor in England.
In Scotland Wren’s way still prevails to a large extent.
There was nothing slapdash about Wren’s
methods: everything was recorded in the most
orderly and detailed manner. If materials delivered
to St. Paul’s were for any reason transferred to one
of the City churches, most careful entry was made
in the accounts of the quantities and values, and the
necessary debits and credits were taken into account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
when the contractors’ bills were settled. Wren was
as efficient in business details as he was in design.</p>

<p>If my memory does not deceive me (and some
thieving friend has made it impossible for me to
verify my reference), it was Mr. G. K. Chesterton,
in <i>Biography for Beginners</i>, who made moving
comment on an imaginative picture of Wren in the
act of being helped into a fur coat by an obsequious
flunkey, as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Sir Christopher Wren</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Went to dine with some men.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>“If any body calls</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Say I’m designing St. Paul’s.”</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>Perhaps the major part of his long life of work was
taken up by far less attractive tasks, for he was
His Majesty’s Office of Works and His Majesty’s
Office of Woods and Forests of his day rolled into
one. The Privy Council called on him for reports
on questions of all kinds. Elmes ploughed through
a manuscript book of the Council’s transactions
on almost every page of which Wren’s name appears.
One Mr. Berkehead wanted to build a house and
brew-house at Knightsbridge. Was this in contravention
of His Majesty’s proclamation? No,
it was too far out of town, and Mr. Berkehead may
proceed. May Mr. Sleymaker build on an old
foundation in Brick Lane? He gets his permission.
Sir Richard Stydolfe had improperly started building
at the rear of St. Giles’s Church leading from thence
to Piccadilly. May he go on? The Surveyor-General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
goes off to St. Giles’s, examines the whole
matter and reports that he should be so licensed
“provided the said Sir Richard Stydolfe build
regularly, according to direction and according to a
design to which his said licence may refer; that he
be obliged to build with brick, with party walls,
with sufficient scantlings, good paving in the streets,
and sufficient sewers and conveyances for the
water ...” and so forth and so on. The Colonel
Panton who gave his name to Panton Street was in
similar trouble, but Wren found that the Colonel’s
building scheme would “cure the noysomeness of
the place” and “the design of the building shewn
to me may be very usefull to the publique.” Wren was
constructive in everything he did, and did not merely
deal with the current business that was referred to
him. Some builders in Soe Hoe “(surely a pleasanter
spelling than Soho)” were building small and mean
habitations, “receptacles for the poorer sort and the
offensive trades” and rendering the government
of these parts more unmanageable. His Majesty’s
Sergeant Plumber was much upset about the manifest
decay of the waters in the expenseful drains and
conduits of Whitehall Palace which resulted from
these nefarious proceedings in Soe Hoe, and Wren
supported him with a petition. Soe Hoe had gone
too far. His Majesty in person, His Majesty’s royal
brother and Prince Rupert, and the Archbishop of
Canterbury and others in full council, looked into
the matter, met more than once about it. Wren
was ordered to see that obedience be given to His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Majesty’s proclamation: failing which, he was to
imprison the workmen for contempt.</p>

<p>Lord Rochester asks him to examine the bills
for repairing the Royal stables, and Wren goes
through them and finds “the particular prices very
reasonable, one thing with another.”</p>

<p>But sometimes Wren must have been bored.
Finding lodgings for Mr. Ronchi at St. James’s was
hardly a task for the creator of St. Paul’s, but he
found them. In 1679 he was in professional touch
with the troubles that followed the finding of Sir
Edmondsbury Godfrey dead in a ditch. Papists’
plots were in the air. The Spanish Ambassador
became highly unpopular, and the Lords’ Committee
appointed to look into “the late horrid conspiracy”
ordered Sir Christopher Wren and Edward Warcup,
Esq., to put padlocks on all such doors as open out
of Mr. Weld’s house into the Ambassador’s house.</p>

<p>So “we repaired to Wild-house and having
viewed the dores ... we affixed padlocks ...”
and much more to the same effect, “all which we
humbly submit.” I am glad to add that His Excellency
showed great civility to Wren in the
character of locksmith. In all these proceedings,
as Elmes justly remarks, “the honour, integrity and
public spirit of Wren appear transcendent.”</p>

<p>I must add a word about Wren as a draughtsman.
The drawings which can with certainty be attributed
to his own hand show him to have been a
competent but not a good performer. A man so
immersed in multifarious work had no time for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
niceties of the drawing-board, and it is probable
that his details were drawn roughly in the shops of
his contractors or “on the job,” as the work progressed.
The idea was complete in his own mind,
and with workmen used to his words and wishes
verbal instructions on his frequent visits would
forward the work without the elaborated drawings
and details of a modern contract. Differences
were adjusted by the simple methods of trade
measurement in use. But that he attached great
importance to drawing as an element in a liberal
education is shown by a reference in Christ’s Hospital
Committee Book, and it is delightful to find here
once more the association of Wren and Pepys.</p>

<p>“At a committee of the Schooles in Christ’s
Hospitall, the 30th November, 1692, ... Mr.
Treasurer acquainted the committee that he had
two letters one from Sir Christo. Wren and the
other from Esq. Pepys declaring their opinions
concerning the introducing the art of drawing
among the Boyes.”</p>

<p>Wren’s letter, which Mr. Nathaniel Hawes read
aloud to the Committee, is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“Nov. 24th, 1692.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>“... It was observed by somebody there
present [at his house] that our English Artists are dull
enough at invention but when once a foreigne patterne
is sett they imitate soe well that commonly they exceed
the Originall, I confess the observation is generally true,
but this showes that our natives want not a Genius but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
education in that w<sup>ch</sup> is the foundation of all Mechanick
Arts, a practice in designing or drawing, to w<sup>ch</sup> everybody
in Italy, France and the Low Countries pretends
more or less. I cannot imagine that next to good
writing anything could be more usefully taught your
children especially such as will naturally take to it, and
many such you will find amongst your Numbers who
will have a naturall genius to it, which it is a pity should
be stifled.... It is not Painters, Sculptors, Gravers,
only that will find an advantage in such Boyes, but
many other Artificers too long to enumerate. Noe

only your Charity of the House will be enlarged but the
Nation advantaged....</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your affectionate friend and humble servant,</span><br>

“<span class="smcap">Chr. Wren</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>This is a strong plea for the teaching of drawing
in schools, but there is, as always, the same practical
comment. Draughtsmanship is of value as the
foundation of the “mechanick arts,” but it comes
next to “good writing.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>STUDENT AND SCHOLAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> attempting some sketch of Wren’s position
in the world of English Architecture, in which
will be set down his own outlook on his art, mainly
in his own words, it seems reasonable to describe
his attitude towards the past and the views of others.
The liveliness and modernity of his mind did not
blind him to the lessons of antiquity, and his essays
in the “restoration” of classical buildings show
him to have been an earnest antiquary. Criticism
of his conclusions must carry with it the remembrance
that the <i>apparatus criticus</i> was exceedingly limited
in his day, when the book was everything. The
spade had not yet revealed a superior authority
and opened out a vast prospect of boundless antiquity
and tradition.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features of the
interleaved documents in the heirloom <i>Parentalia</i>
is the sketch of Wren’s conjectural restoration of
the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> The last note
of the printed <i>Parentalia</i> is headed, “Of the Sepulchre
of Mausolus, King of Caria.” It ends with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
words, “The plate of the above is omitted, on
account of the drawing being imperfect.”</p>

<p>This imperfect drawing is pasted on the last page
of the <i>Discourse</i> in the heirloom copy, and shows
Wren to be less careful as an archæologist than
might have been anticipated. “The Sepulchre,”
he writes, “is so well described by Pliny that I
have attempted to design it accordingly, and also
very open, conformable to the Description in
Martial, <i>Aere vacuo Pendentia Mausolea</i>, and yet
it wanted not the solidity of the Dorick order;”
and he goes on to say, on very insufficient grounds,
“I conclude this work must be the exactest Form
of the Dorick.”</p>

<p>The odd thing is that Wren had not noticed the
statement of Vitruvius that Pythios, the architect of
the Mausoleum and the sculptor of the chariot group,
gave up the Doric order because of the incongruous
arrangements which arose in its use. Wren’s great
blunder, however, was in the misreading of one word
in Pliny’s description, “Pteron.” He says it is an
unusual term. Russell Sturgis gives its meaning as
“that which forms a side or flank, as the row of
columns along the side of a temple, or the side wall
itself.” It is the more odd that Wren boggled over the
word Pteron, seeing that he used the word Dipteron in
his description of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus.
At Ephesus there was no question in his mind of an
“Attick order rising above the cornice,” but he
takes the Pteron at Halicarnassus to have that
meaning, and to be “a word of Greek Authors of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Architecture now lost.” Anyhow, it pleasantly
exemplifies on how insubstantial a foundation
can rest a piece of architectural criticism which is
based on literary evidence alone.</p>

<p>His mistake naturally vitiates the whole restoration,
apart from the fact that the Mausoleum was
of the Ionic order.</p>

<p>The consideration of Wren’s restoration will send
the student to Professor Lethaby’s illuminating
monographs on “Greek Buildings represented by
fragments in the British Museum.” They must
make him realise again, and more sensitively, the
importance of going to the stones, and setting
aside even Pliny (or, perhaps, especially Pliny) if
he does not confirm their evidence.</p>

<p>On the wall of the Mausoleum Room at the
British Museum is a drawing lettered “Design
by Sir C. Wren from Pliny’s description of the
Tomb of Mausolus, copied from Wren’s book, the
<i>Parentalia</i>,” and signed “J. E. Goodchild, 1893.”
Goodchild was a pupil of Cockerell, who also made
a restoration represented at the British Museum
both by a drawing and a model. In the MS. of
the <i>Parentalia</i> at the Royal Society is a sheet
with a rough sketch-plan, doubtless from Wren’s
hand. From it and from Wren’s description, Goodchild
presumably made his drawing. The sketch
elevation in the heirloom copy gives an infinitely
better-proportioned and more reasonable building
than Goodchild’s. There is the possibility that the
imperfect drawing referred to in the <i>Parentalia</i> is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
the sketch-plan bound up with the MS., but I feel
sure the elevation in the heirloom copy is indicated.
Goodchild’s description on the drawing suggests
that he had merely copied from the <i>Parentalia</i>. It
would have been more correct had he said “based
on indications in the <i>Parentalia</i>.”</p>

<p>A word may be added about Wren’s description
(printed in the <i>Parentalia</i>) of the Artemision at
Ephesus. There are bound, in the ordinary copies
of the book, engravings of a plan and elevation of
the Temple, and also a plan and elevation of Wren’s
conjectural restoration of the shrine of the goddess.</p>

<p>The odd feature of this restoration is again
Wren’s reliance on Pliny’s figures, which would
have made what Professor Lethaby calls a temple
of “enormous and impossible size.” In order to
fit in Pliny’s 127 columns, Wren has to make
the fronts decastyle. To absorb the odd number
of columns he invents a quite enchanting shrine
which has small claim to credibility, and rather
recalls the garden temples of the eighteenth century.
He again neglects the safer guidance of Vitruvius,
who states that the temple was octastyle. His
observations on the Temple of Peace built by
Vespasian include some charming phrases: “Each
Deity had a peculiar Gesture, Face, and Dress
hieroglyphically proper to it; as then Stories were
but Morals involved: and not only their Altars
and Sacrifices were mystical, but the very Forms
of their Temples. No Language, no Poetry can
so describe Peace, and the Effects of it in Men’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
Minds, as the Design of the Temple naturally
paints it, without any affectation of the Allegory.
It is easy of Access, and open, carries an humble
Front, but embraces wide, is luminous and pleasant,
and content with an internal Greatness, despises
an invidious Appearance of all that Heighth it
might otherwise justly boast of, but rather fortifying
itself on every Side, rests secure on a Square and
ample Basis.”</p>

<p>But devotion to the antiquities of Greece did not
hinder Wren from digging deeply into the history
of Roman Britain, and his conclusions as to the
London of the Romans are quoted with respect
by the archæologists of to-day.</p>

<p>Amongst the criticisms directed against Wren as an
antiquary are those which are concerned with his
Gothic exercises. One otherwise devout admirer says
of St. Dunstan-in-the-East, St. Mary’s, Aldermary,
and St. Michael’s, Cornhill: “Whether Wren made
these designs under pressure, or merely as academical
exercises for the entertainment of his friends is
unknown, but it is very evident that he had not
the least sympathy with Gothic architecture, or
taken any trouble to master its most rudimentary
features.” Without going into the reasons for
these Gothic adventures beyond dismissing the idea
that Wren made such solid entertainment for his
friends, it is at least safe to reply that Wren understood
the nature of Gothic very well. That is not
to say that he could reproduce it, but the informed
student of any phase of art is not necessarily the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
person to create it. In 1669 he made a survey
of Salisbury Cathedral for his old friend Bishop
Seth Ward, and wrote a report which shows a true
critical appreciation of the problems of the mediæval
architect, of where he failed but also of where he
succeeded. There is none of the contemptuous
violence used by the virtuous Evelyn when he
refers to Gothic, which led the way for Ruskin’s
later vehemence about the “foul torrent of the
Renaissance.” Wren merely remarks, “This Form
of Churches has been rejected by modern Architects
abroad, who use the better and Roman Art of
Architecture,” and commends the proportions of
the nave and aisles: “The Mouldings are decently
mixed with large Planes, without an Affectation
of filling every Corner with Ornaments, ... the
Architect trusted to a stately and rich plainness.”
Wren’s criticisms are directed to the foundations,
the low level of the floor, the insufficient size of the
pillars, and the bracing of the walls with iron. He
also objected, with some justice, to the poise of the
aisle vaulting, supported from without by buttresses
but not within save by the pillars themselves.</p>

<p>It happened that Wren had to concern himself
intimately with other “congestions of heavy dark
melancholy and monkish piles, without any just
proportion, use or beauty” (the phrase is Evelyn’s),
such as Westminster Abbey. For twenty-five years
he was Surveyor to the Abbey, and wrote a Report
on it in 1713. We may pass over his historical
paragraphs, which show shrewdness of observation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
for his <i>obiter dicta</i> on Gothic methods. He disliked
the “flutter of archbuttresses,” as they “occasion
the Ruin of Cathedrals, being so much exposed
to the Air and Weather,” but is tolerant of
Henry VII.’s Chapel, “a nice embroidered Work.”</p>

<p>We have learnt by dire experience the heavy
burden of repairs incident to the mediæval system
of external supports by flying arches, pinnacles,
and buttresses in our climate. He goes on to specify
necessary repairs, some done, and others needed,
and to plead for the finishing of the West Front and
the completion of the Central Tower with the addition
of a spire, which “will give a proper Grace to
the whole Fabrick, and the West End of the City,
which seems to want it.”</p>

<p>Sir Charles Barry was later to be equally concerned
with the idea of completing the outline of
the Abbey, as his last designs show.</p>

<p>Wren’s common sense and real respect for Gothic
are alike shown by his proposal for the spire:
“I have made a Design, which will not be very
expensive but light, and still in the Gothic form,
and of a Style with the rest of the Structure, which
I would strictly adhere to, throughout the whole
Intention: <i>to deviate from the old Form would be to
run into a disagreeable Mixture: which no Person
of a good Taste could relish</i>.”</p>

<p>He went on to talk of the north window, then
stopped with plaster to prevent its total ruin,
and said his models for the new work were “such
as I conceive may agree with the original scheme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
of the old Architect, <i>without any modern mixtures
to shew my own Inventions</i>.” His North Transept
Front was swept away by Pearson, not to everyone’s
satisfaction, and though the Gothic grammar
of it was inevitably at fault, because he was trying
to do something against the current of the times,
the failure was not due to any lack of appreciation
of Gothic. The existing western towers were not
built in Wren’s lifetime and he need not be charged
with the defects of their execution by the introduction
of definitely classical cornices and other
details of a type which Wren would not have used.
So much for Wren as a student of Gothic. I come
now to an example of the use he made of other
men’s writings.</p>

<p>In the library of Shirburn Castle there is a copy
of Wotton’s <i>Elements of Architecture</i>, first edition,
1624, annotated by the hand of Sir Christopher
himself. It is worth while quoting from these
notes in some detail, because they show that Wren
was a careful reader and that he was quick to mark
every kind of practical application of what he read.
The page references are to the first edition of the
<i>Elements</i>.</p>

<p>Where Wotton says of staircases (on p. 58)
that “the breadth of every single step should
never be less than one foot, nor more than
eighteen inches,” Wren adds “nor so much as
eighteen inches at any time, for if a step exceed
twelve, those who have but short [legs] must
tread twice upon the same step, especially in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
descent, which, to women especially, is troublesome,
and dangerous to the hasty.” James Wyatt,
in the circular staircase of Devonshire House, erred in
this way, with exactly the effect that Wren describes.
One bears in mind in this connection that Wren himself
was of short stature. On p. 55 Wotton discourses
of the advantage of luminous rooms: “Indeed,
I must confess that a frank light can misbecome
no edifice whatsoever, temples only excepted,
which were anciently dark, as they are likewise
at this day in some proportion, devotion more
requiring collected than defused spirits,” on which
Wren makes the comment that Christ Church in
London was practically nothing but window,
and was fitter for a stage than for a church,
“although for the kind of building it is a thorough
piece of work.” On gardens and their treatment
with aqueducts, walks, etc., Wren makes the note,
“And for disposing the current of a river to a mighty
length in a little space I invented the Serpentine,
a form admirably convoying the current in circular
and yet contrary motions upon one and the same
level, with walks and retirements between to the
advantage of all purposes, either of gardenings,
plantings, or banquetings ... far beyond the
bungarly [!] invention at Hatfield so much liked
for pleasure.” Up and down the book there are
scattered all manner of other interesting notes.
There is a practical thought in Wren’s reference
to the very small chimneys in use in Spain, where
charcoal was sold by weight. He has evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
had difficulty with smoky chimneys, for to Wotton’s
observation, “Then there is a repulsion of the fume
by some higher hill or fabrique that shall overtop
the chimney,” he makes the significant comment,
“As in our buildings here.”</p>

<p>In connection with terracing any story (by which
Wotton seems to have meant the making of loggias),
Wren remarks: “Terracing is most commended
in hotter climates, and in our country must serve
mostly for summer rooms.” To Wotton’s general
reflection that “various colours on the out-walls
of buildings have always in them more delight
than dignity,” Wren adds the criticism in Latin
that in this particular the noble building of Lord
Exeter at Wimbledon also offends. He seems,
however, to have been friendly to the use of mosaic,
for he says: “Herein excels that excellent cave at
Bodington wherein stands the brazen hydra with
seven springs out of seven heads.” With regard
to the art of the plasterer, Wotton had said:
“Plastique is not only under sculpture, but indeed
very sculpture itself, with this difference that the
plasterer doth make his figures by addition, and
the carver by subtraction.” Wren makes short
work of this with, “This proposition can never
hold true to the name of sculpture.”</p>

<p>At the end of the <i>Elements</i> Wotton promises
another work, “A Philosophical Survey of Education,
which is indeed a Second Building or Repairing
of Nature, and, as I may term it, a kind of moral
architecture.” Wren must have taken considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
pleasure from the <i>Elements</i>, for in the margin he
has written: “Oh that we might see that, so long
expected.”</p>

<p>There are bits of detailed criticism in his first
<i>Tract</i> which might have been used in recent comments
on a great London building: “Fronts ought
to be elevated in the Middle, not the Corners; because
the Middle is the place of greatest Dignity and
first arrests the Eye; and rather projecting forward
in the Middle, than hollow. For these Reasons,
Pavilions at the Corners are naught; because they
make both Faults, a hollow and depressed Front....
No Roof can have Dignity enough to appear
above a Cornice, but the Circular: in private
Buildings it is excusable.”</p>

<p>We know little about the amount of Wren’s
general reading, but he was certainly a student of
Elyot’s <i>Governour</i>. Some years ago I was the
means of placing in the R.I.B.A. Library the 1546
edition of this once famous but now almost forgotten
book. Its chief interest lies in the fact that
it bears the autographs on the title-page of Sir
Christopher’s father, Dean Christopher Wren, and
of Sir Christopher himself. The other writings
scribbled on the margins are the work of much earlier
owners of the volume, which was nearly a century
old when the Dean acquired it. There is some
little evidence that the architect studied the book
with care. Sir Thomas Elyot was concerned to
set out the whole behaviour of a knightly gentleman,
and among other things gives some warnings against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the use of oaths. When Sir Christopher was building
St. Paul’s Cathedral he was distressed by the
profanity of the workmen, and posted up a notice
directed against bad language. It is possible that
he consulted the <i>Governour</i> before drafting this
notice, for the page references in the index under
the heading “othes” has been corrected from 170
to 160, and this was possibly done by Wren when he
sought for what Elyot had to say about oaths.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>“THE ARCHITECT OF ADVENTURE”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> trying to estimate with any precision what is
Wren’s position in the history of British Architecture,
the immediate and obvious comparison
is with Inigo Jones. I refer to Wren in my Preface
as our architect of greatest achievement, because
I hesitate to use the simpler words—our greatest
architect. In my own mind the latter is a true
description, but the enthusiasts for Inigo Jones
would dispute it. None, however, can cavil at the
statement that Wren achieved more than any
other English architect, whatever nice distinctions
may be drawn as to the relative greatness of his
art and that of Inigo Jones. The two men are
not strictly comparable, and represent in their
work and outlook two different currents in the
history of architecture. Inigo Jones was essentially
academic and, in his relationship to the traditional
methods of building which he found, the
forerunner of the modern professional architect.
He had trained himself by much foreign travel
and by close study of the facts of building before
he embarked on his career. Wren, on the other
hand, was essentially an amateur, if the word be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
understood in its most favourable sense and not
in the least contemptuously. Inigo Jones was not
an inventor. He took the Palladio tradition as his
model and adhered to it with faithfulness. Wren
does not seem to have had any particular hero
amongst the great Italian architects. He kept
throughout his career a free mind, open to the
suggestions of his own inventiveness, ready to accept
existing conditions, rather than academic rules,
as the guides to his treatment of a problem, and
eager to try new structural ideas.</p>

<p>It must plainly be said that Wren suffered
frequent lapses of taste, and it does no service
to his great memory to gloss over these faults.
As a result of them it happened that practically
no work of Wren, however noble in its conception,
however magnificent its solution of difficult
problems, can be freed from criticism in detail.
He did not produce the complete unity against
which no criticism can lie. Of Inigo Jones at
St. Paul’s, Covent Garden (as it was before it was
rebuilt), and again at the Banqueting Hall, of
Robert Adam in the hall at Syon, and of Sir Charles
Barry at the Reform Club, it can be said that they
made no mistakes. Each achievement is complete
and perfect in its kind. But it is impossible to
say that even of St. Paul’s Cathedral: there are
elements in its design which are weak and confused.
Even in the steeple of St. Mary-le-Bow, which is
very nearly perfect, the diameter of the cylinder
enclosed by the ring of columns is hardly right.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
This sort of criticism is even more true of the
majority of the City churches. The cause for this
lack of perfection is not difficult to find. Wren
was an amateur, not only by the cast of his mind,
but by the circumstances of his entry into architecture:
he was imperfectly trained for his work.</p>

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">S<small><sup>T</sup></small> MARY-LE-BOW</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If he had followed the example of Inigo Jones and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
studied the Italian Renaissance on the spot, not only
in respect of design, but also of the facts of building,
he would have avoided many pitfalls. Great as
is the part which the knowledge of mathematics
and geometry plays in his art, nothing did and
nothing could take the place of the practical
knowledge of the art of building which Jones
possessed and Wren lacked, at least until his later
years.</p>

<p>It is possible, for example, that the present
trouble at St. Paul’s Cathedral would have been
avoided if Wren, whose whole admiration was for
the Roman manner of building, had gone to Rome
to see what, in fact, Roman building was. He
would then have learnt that Roman builders did
not carry immense weights on piers which consisted,
as at St. Paul’s, of a core of rubble cased in by
finely jointed ashlar. He would have found that
it was advisable to build them either of ashlar
throughout, or, if he had decided on a rubble core
with an ashlar casing, to interrupt the rubble
core at reasonable intervals by courses of hard
tiles or bricks. These would have prevented the
perpendicular settlement of the rubble that has
now disturbed the relation between the rubble
and the ashlar casing. The professional Inigo
Jones would not have made that mistake. The
amateur Wren did. And there is little excuse
for this fault. In his Report on St. Paul’s, written
before the Fire, Wren is very contemptuous of his
Gothic predecessor: “The work was both ill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
design’d and ill built from the Beginning: ill design’d,
because the Architect gave not Butment enough to
counterpoise and resist the weight of the Roof from
spreading the Walls; for the Eye alone will discover
to any man that those Pillars, as vast as they are,
even eleven Foot diameter, are bent outwards at
least six inches from their first position. This
bending of the Pillars was facilitated by their
<i>ill Building, for they are only cased without, and that
with small stones, not one greater than a Man’s
Burden; but within it is nothing but a Core of small
Rubbish-stone, and much mortar</i>, which easily crushes
and yields to the weight.” When the time came
for Wren to build the piers that carry his dome,
he fell into exactly the same blunder.</p>

<p>He was similarly defeated sometimes by problems
of design for lack of knowledge of the history of
his art, and by too great a reliance on his own
invention. In trying at St. Paul’s to marry the
idea of a great central dome to the Gothic cruciform
plan with a determination to preserve the long
vista down the aisles, he involved himself in difficulties
in the support of the dome which he could
not safely overcome without clumsy elements of
design, to be discussed later.</p>

</figure>

<p>Yet, in spite of all his technical ignorance, he
succeeded because of the essential greatness of
his mind. In succeeding, he carried architecture
forward, not by a normal development, but by
leaps and bounds, so far indeed, that there was
found no one to follow him in that line of development.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Hawksmoor was an exceedingly capable
architect who had benefited, so far as his capacity
would allow, by thirty-two years of close association
with the master; but, as Sir Reginald Blomfield
has said, he was always trying to interpret Vanbrugh
in terms of Wren. While he was under the influence
of Wren he designed like Wren, when he
came under the influence of Vanbrugh he designed
like Vanbrugh.</p>

<p>Of Wren’s own outlook on his art we fortunately
possess illuminating notes, not only in his printed
Tracts, but in a MS. bound up with the heirloom
<i>Parentalia</i>. It was printed by Miss Phillimore,
and forms the text of Professor Lethaby’s enchanting
essay on “The Architecture of Adventure,”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
from which I have borrowed the heading of this
chapter—an acknowledgment, trivial though it be,
of the debt I owe to its author.</p>

<p>Wren’s paper is no more than a fragment, but it is
a noble fragment and begins thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whatever a man’s sentiments are upon mature
deliberation, it will still be necessary for him in
a conspicuous Work to preserve his Undertaking
from general censure, and so for him to accommodate
his Designs to the gust of the Age he lives in, tho’
it appears to him less rational. I have found no
little difficulty to bring Persons, of otherwise a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
good genius, to think anything in Architecture
would be better than what they had heard commended
by others, and what they had view’d themselves.
Many good Gothick forms of Cathedrals
were to be seen in our Country, and many had been
seen abroad, which they liked the better for being
not much different from ours in England: this
humour with many is not yet eradicated, and,
therefore, I judge it not improper to endeavour
to reform the Generality to a truer taste in Architecture
by giving a larger Idea of the whole Art,
beginning with the reasons and progress of it,
from the most remote Antiquity; and that in short
touching chiefly on some things which have not been
remarked by others. The Project of Building
is as natural to Mankind as to Birds; and was
practised before the Flood.”</p>
</div>

<p>And then Wren goes off into musings on the construction
of the Ark, the Tower of Babel, the
Pyramids, and the Sepulchre of Porsenna as described
by Pliny, finishing with this luminous phrase:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been the longer in this Description, because
the Fabrick was in the Age of Pythagoras and his
School, <i>when the World began to be fond of Geometry
and Arithmetick</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was the core of Wren’s claim as an architect,
the reliance upon scientific rather than traditional
elements in design. He develops the idea in his
first Tract printed in <i>Parentalia</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Beauty is a Harmony of Objects, begetting
Pleasure by the Eye. There are two Causes of
Beauty—natural and customary. Natural is from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
Geometry, consisting in Uniformity (that is
equality) and Proportion. Customary Beauty is
begotten by the Use of our Senses to those Objects
which are usually pleasing to us for other Causes,
as Familiarity or particular Inclination breeds
a Love to Things not in themselves lovely. Here
lies the great Occasion of Errors, here is tried the
Architects Judgment, but always the true Test
is natural or geometrical Beauty. Geometrical
Figures are naturally more beautiful than other
irregular; in this all consent as to a Law of Nature.
Of geometrical Figures, the Square and the Circle
are most beautiful; next the Parallelogram and the
Oval. Straight Lines are more beautiful than Curve....
There are only two beautiful Positions of
strait Lines, perpendicular and horizontal; this
is from Nature and consequently Necessity, no
other than upright being firm.”</p>
</div>

<p>Wren’s acute judgment noted the great part
played by such factors as historical association,
one of the “other causes,” in the public appreciation
of architecture.</p>

<p>Earlier in the Tract he makes obeisance to the
three principles which had been laid down by
earlier writers, but with a characteristic rider:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Beauty, Firmness and Convenience are the
Principles: the two first depend upon geometrical
Reasons of Opticks and Staticks; the third only
makes the Variety.”</p>
</div>

<p>Scholarly though Wren was in his art, he took
nothing for granted, but examined the common-places
with a desire to establish reasons for them
or reject them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“Modern authors who have treated of Architecture
seem generally to have little more in view, but to
set down the Proportions of Columns, Architraves
and Cornices in the several Orders, as they are
distinguished into Dorick, Ionick, Corinthian, and
Composite, and in these Proportions finding them
in the ancient Fabricks of the Greeks and Romans
(though more arbitrarily used than they care to
acknowledge) they have reduced them into Rules,
too strict and pedantick, and so as not to be transgressed,
without the Crime of Barbarity, though
in their own Nature they are but the Modes and
Fashions of those ages wherein they were used.”</p>
</div>

<p>There is a very modern ring about the following
moralising:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Although Architecture contains many excellent
Parts, besides the ranging of Pillars, yet Curiosity
may lead us to consider whence this Affectation
arose originally, so as to judge nothing beautiful
but what was adorned with Columns, even where
there was no real use of them.... It will be to
the purpose, therefore, to examine whence proceeded
this Affectation of a Mode which hath continued
now at least 3,000 years, and the rather, because it
may lead us to the Grounds of Architecture and by
what Steps this Humour of Colonades came into
Practice in all Ages.”</p>
</div>

<p>But for all his contempt of the pedantry of rules
of proportion, which the greatest architects of
antiquity did not observe unless it suited them,
he saw in the Orders themselves something eternal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Architecture aims at Eternity; and therefore
<i>the only thing uncapable of Modes and Fashions in
its Principals</i>, the Orders. The Orders are not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Roman and Greek, but Phœnician, Hebrew, and
Assyrian, being founded upon the Experience of
all Ages, promoted by the vast Treasures of all the
great Monarchs, and skill of the greatest Artists
and Geometricians, every one emulating each other.”</p>
</div>

<p>Wren rises to his greatest height in the opening
of his first Tract, and shows that if his life had fallen
out otherwise, he might have left a reputation
as a writer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Architecture has its political Use; Public
Buildings being the Ornament of a Country; it
establishes a Nation, draws People and Commerce;
makes the People love their native Country, which
Passion is the Original of all great Actions in a
Commonwealth. The Emulation of the Cities of
Greece was the true Cause of their Greatness.
The obstinate Valour of the Jews, occasioned by
the Love of their Temple, was a Cement that held
together that People, for many Ages, through
infinite Changes.”</p>
</div>

<p>I have quoted at what may seem to be inordinate
length, but Wren is justified alike by the content
of his thought and the aptness of his phrase, and I
am concerned rather to reveal the man than my
idea of him.</p>

<p>In all Wren’s writings he shows an acute perception
of the fact that architecture has had an immensely
long evolution. He had, of course, no
suspicion as to how far back its origins were to be
sought, but clearly he was approaching the idea
that forms, once constructive, pass into decoration
and become part of the language of architecture.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
This is the final and, as I believe, the effective reply
to the puritan theorist, who cries aloud for the
discarding of traditional features in art. Sir Joshua
Reynolds warned his students that the business
of a painter is to paint a fine picture, and that he
is not to be cheated of his materials by specious
arguments. Wren was clear-sighted enough to see
that the Orders have a definite beauty value: his
only trouble was that he was not fully equipped
to bend them wholly to his will. The western
front of St. Paul’s may be taken as an instance.
As a Whole it is a magnificent composition, and a
source of inspiration to everyone with any feeling
for architecture, but can it be pretended that the
segmental vault of the upper portico does not belie
the entablature and pediment in front of it? Wren
could cut away architrave and frieze inside for
the benefit of his great arches, and refer his critics
to the Temple of Peace (now the Basilica of Maxentius)
at Rome for his authority, but he lacked
the insight or the courage to deal with the external
problem in the same fashion. The fact is that the
great architect of any age is both leader and led,
and cannot wholly escape the limitations of his
time. But there are valid compensations. His
work could not be justly representative of the age,
one of the significant values of architecture, if
he could entirely dissociate himself from his age.
When it is remembered that Sir William Chambers
can actually say in his <i>Civil Architecture</i> (1759)
that every time he passes St. Paul’s he regrets that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
the pilasters have no entasis—probably few know
it—we can form an idea of the limitations of
thought that Wren would have to encounter.
Vitruvius,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> with all his imperfections, was still
enthroned, and few, if any, had yet divined the real
relation of that retired military engineer to the
arts of Greece and Rome. Wren had the true spirit
of Bacon, and, with further travel, might have seen
further through the idols of his market-place.</p>

<p>He seems to have realised the trouble in which
he had involved himself in the arches of the octagon
that supports his mighty dome. Every architectural
student since his day has sat and speculated
as to what the solution might have or should have
been. Wren left a sufficiently feeble suggestion
of curtains and seated apostles, occupying the
tribunes (three in each presumably), as a means of
veiling the defect. But the difficulty goes deeper
than that: the octagon is peculiarly troublesome
to handle in terms of the Orders, as a number of
failures exist to show.</p>

<p>Wren’s work was always improving. The last,
and westernmost, bay of St. Paul’s inside shows
more breadth and grandeur, but the carving of the
spandrels is so strange that one wonders if it can
really be original. This brings us to a characteristic
of Wren which probably accounts for some of his
lapses of taste. It seems likely that he was not hard-hearted
enough with the people who worked under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
him, that he was too generous, too ready to accept
things on his assistants’ and craftsmen’s assurance
that they were the best that could be produced.
He may thus have been led into an occasional
acquiescence, both in design and construction, in
things which he must have well known were not
really right. Confronted with every sort of difficulty,
and none too well backed, he must have been
desperately anxious to avoid delays. His very
ingenuity, moreover, would lead him to make the
most of what was available. Unfortunately in
works of <i>eternity</i>—architecture aims at eternity—such
compromises meet with a stern Nemesis.</p>

<p>In the two centuries that have elapsed since
his death Wren has been admired and followed
from very different points of view. It has been
justly said that he has been in fashion and out
of fashion and is now above fashion. Any doubt
as to the reality and massive quality of his genius
can easily be dissipated by a consideration of
what imitators have done. No domed church
on the lines of St. Paul’s has achieved equal beauty
and grandeur, nor have any of the innumerable
steeples, based on his inventions, been of the same
rank. In domestic buildings, his special character
remains pre-eminent and informs the best work of
to-day—a certain graciousness that in others
degenerated often into heaviness. There is a vast
gap between Wren at Hampton Court and Talman
at Chatsworth.</p>

<p>Thus it is that in this Bicentenary Year there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
is the same feeling that caused Sir John Vanbrugh
to refuse the succession to his office “out of tenderness
for Sir Christopher Wren,” and that led the
<i>Spectator</i> to publish a noble tribute repudiating
the ingratitude of his dismissal. The lovers of
architecture everywhere will feel that in honouring
Wren they have honoured the Art to which a
man of such amazing gifts and nobility of character
was content to devote the flower of his life.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher Wren was the very fulfilment
of Wotton’s prophecy—“Architecture can want
no commendation, where there are Noble Men or
Noble mindes.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">APPENDIX I<br>

<small>A NOTE IN AMPLIFICATION OF THE REFERENCE
IN CHAPTER IV. TO PASCAL’S PROBLEM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mathematicians</span> who wished to answer Pascal’s
challenge were given until October 1, 1658, for a
solution, and an umpire, M. de Cavarci, was nominated,
and the prizes were 40 doubloons or pistoles and for the
second, 20. In a letter of October 10 Pascal says he
has received both attempts at solutions of the problems
set and also a number of discussions of matters connected
with the cycloid which did not pretend to be
solutions of his problem:</p>

<p>“Mais entre tous les écrits qu’on a recues de cette
sorte, il n’y a rien de plus beau que ce qui a été envoyé
par M. Wren; car outre la belle manière qu’il donne
de mesurer le plan de la roulette (=cycloid), il a donné
la comparaison de la ligne courbe même et ses parties,
avec la ligne droit: sa proposition est que la ligne de la
roulette est quadruple de son axe, dont il a envoyé
l’énonciation sans démonstration. Et comme il est le
premier qui l’a produite, c’est sans doute a lui que
l’honneur de la première invention en appartient.”</p>

<p>Summing up his history of the cycloid, he concluded
that the first to remark that curve in nature was
P. Mersenne, that M. de Roberval first worked out some of
its properties, “que le premier qui en a mesuré la ligne
courbe a été M. Wren.”</p>

<p>The story is then taken up by a letter of Cavarci
(dated December 10, 1658), the umpire, to Pascal (now
masquerading under a new pseudonym—A. Dettonville
= an anagram of Louis de Montalte), in which he recites
the nature of the problems set—<i>i.e.</i>, to find the dimensions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
and centres of gravity of the solids generated by the
revolution of the cycloid. He goes on to say that there
were sent solutions of the more easy problems—“savoir:
le centre de gravité de la ligne courbe et la dimension
des solides, lequelle M. Wren nous envoya dans ses
lettres du 12 Octobre”—but concludes that of the
challenge problem no solutions had been sent.</p>

<p>Pascal replied to this letter with a series of letters
setting out a general method for dealing with such
problems and the actual solutions of the problems he
had proposed.</p>

<p>The real quarrel as to whether the problems had been
solved or not was with Wallis and not with Wren.
Wallis appears to have sent a solution and followed it
up by various letters offering corrections. However,
he was adjudged wrong in principle (see Récit de
l’Examen pour les prix sur la Roulette). The prizes
were not awarded. Wallis afterwards (1659) published
a “Tractatus de Cycloide,” in which are included four
propositions on the cycloid which Wren had given to
Wallis.</p>

<p>Turning now to Wren’s counter problem. It is not
directly connected with the cycloid, but with one of the
properties of the ellipse, and it had previously been
suggested by Kepler. It appears to have been confused
with Pascal’s cycloid problems because Pascal showed
in his general method that various cycloid problems
could be referred to the ellipse. Pascal has a chapter,
“L’égalité entre les lignes courbes de toutes sortes de
Roulettes et les lignes elliptiques,” in the course of which
he remarks, “Cette admirable égalité de la courbe de la
roulette simple à une droite [=straight line] que M.
Wren a trouvée, n’était, pour aussi dire, q’une égalité
par accident, qui vient de ce qu’en ce cas l’ellipse se
trouvé réduite à une droite.” Wren’s challenge seems
to have remained unnoticed.</p>

<small>AN ATTEMPT AT A WREN CHRONOLOGY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><i><span class="smcap">The</span> dates of Wren’s work have been set down so wildly
that I prefer the omission of some buildings to the repetition
of blunders. Even so I have no doubt repeated many old
mistakes and made some fresh ones. An accurate chronology
of Wren would be of great comfort to the student. I
have checked only forty-seven of Miss Milman’s dates, but
found forty-five of them wrong, by from one to twenty-five
years.</i></p>

<p><i>The City churches are given under the year during which
the first payment to the builders was made: the dates in
brackets mark the last of such payments, which may well
have been some years after the buildings were completed.
Wren seems to have settled final accounts in batches.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">APPENDIX III<br>

<small>A NOTE ON SOME PORTRAITS OF WREN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The following brief particulars of several portraits of
Wren, some of which are reproduced in the preceding
pages, may lead to more precise information being
disinterred:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Wren as a Man of Forty</i> (<a href="#Page_50">Plate II.</a>).—When I
saw this, it was in the possession of the late Mrs.
Catherine Pigott. It is now, I believe, in the possession
of the Bishop of Southwell, to whom it passed on Mrs.
Pigott’s death. It is unsigned, and there is no record
as to its authorship. It shows Wren as a young man, and
I had thought it represented him while in the twenties.
Mr. Richard W. Goulding, F.S.A., dates the cravat
about 1675, which would make Wren forty-three. The
modelling of the face is not unlike that of the Pearce
bust, which tends to confirm the age as about forty.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The Wadham College Portrait</i> (<a href="#Page_114">Plate XIII.</a>).—This
is in itself a poor piece of painting, and has a vague
history. It is an 1825 copy by John Smith, of Oxford,
deriving ultimately, it is said, from a Kneller portrait
at Lambeth Palace, which, I am informed, has disappeared.
It seems rather to be based on the Sheldonian
portrait, which was attributed by Dallaway to Thornhill,
“painted in conjunction with Verrio and Kneller.”
I give the unlikely story of its authorship as it is told,
adding only that as the plan in Wren’s hand shows the
St. Paul’s of the Warrant Design or later, it must be after
1675, and therefore Wren is depicted as a man of forty-three
or more, probably a good deal more, for he is
markedly older than in the last mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Bust by Edward Pearce at the Ashmolean</i> (<a href="#Page_70">Plate V.</a>).—This
beautiful work has been dated 1673, by a letter
written by Christopher, the architect’s son, and quoted
by Mr. Lionel Cust. It may well be Wren as a man of
forty-one, and the younger Christopher’s date can be
accepted, but he was very casual in his chronologies.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The Royal Society Portrait.</i>—The legend on the
frame says this picture is by Michael Wright, but
Mr. Collins Baker attributes it, on the ground of
style, to Riley and Closterman in collaboration. He
claims that it is the basis of the Kirkall engraving
(see next note). If so, Kirkall turned the face the
other way. The view of St. Paul’s shows a transitional
design between the Warrant Design with its nightmare
steeple and the dome as built. The clock towers are
almost exactly like the intermediate design preserved
at All Souls. I suggest it shows a man of seventy.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>The Kirkall Engraving after Closterman</i> (<a href="#Page_126">Plate XV.</a>).—This
rare portrait was given to me by Mrs. Pigott
shortly before her death, and apart from its having been,
as she told me, an heirloom in the Wren family, it has
an interest as showing Elisha Kirkall’s “chiaroscuro”
style of engraving interpreting Closterman’s portrait.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) <i>The St. Paul’s Deanery Portrait</i> (<a href="#Page_120">Plate XIV.</a>).—This
is a copy of the best known portrait of all, the
Kneller at the National Portrait Gallery, and an inferior
copy, for it reveals a man of far less distinction, both
in character and feature, than the National portrait.
The latter is attributed to the year 1711, and is therefore
of Wren when he was nearly eighty.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) <i>The Welbeck Portrait</i> (<a href="#Page_60">Plate IV.</a>).—The picture
is a small whole length on panel. The architect wears
a red dressing-gown with white lining, white stockings,
and red shoes; his right hand is placed on his hip, and
in his left hand he holds a drawing of the elevation of
the façade of St. Paul’s. On the left side of the picture
there is a lurid sky indicative of the burning of the City;
in the right-hand top corner is a bust of Charles II.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
flanked by an amorino weighing the insignia of royalty
(crown, sceptre, etc.), against four shields of arms
(England, France, Scotland, and Ireland), and round the
waist of the amorino is a scroll lettered “Justum est.”</p>

<p>This picture was acquired by the fifth Duke of Portland
in 1861. It was then attributed to H. Gascar,
who is stated to have been in England <i>circa</i> 1674-80,
and who might consequently have painted Sir Christopher
soon after he made his design for the new Cathedral.
The West Front is shown in the picture with the single
Order, an early stage of the design. The architect looks
very young for a man of about forty-two years of age,
but in the case of painted portraits it is often difficult to
reconcile the actual age of a sitter with his <i>apparent</i> age.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) <i>The Queen’s College Bust.</i>—This posthumous
portrait has been attributed to Rysbrack; it is certainly
worthy of him. Wren is shown as a very old man.</p>

<p>(<i>k</i>) <i>The Medal at Wadham College</i> (<a href="#Page_148">Plate XVI.</a>).—As
it is commonly said that this medal was struck to
celebrate the completion of St. Paul’s, it is a little unkind
to have to set down the fact that it was cast and chased
(not struck) by G. D. Gaale, a German, about the year
1783, when he exhibited it in London, sixty years after
Wren’s death in 1723.</p>

<p>(<i>l</i>) <i>Art Union of London Medal.</i>—A medal was issued
in 1846: obverse, with bust of Wren, signed H. Wilson,
Sc.; reverse, St. Paul’s, signed B. Wyon.</p>
</div>

<p>I hope the above notes may lead people better informed
than myself to bring out facts which will enable
a full and correct catalogue of Wren portraits to be prepared.
Their publication in the Bicentenary issue of
<i>Architecture</i> brought Mr. Richard W. Goulding to my
aid in correcting some mistakes I then made, and he
has added the facts about the Welbeck portrait.</p>

<p>A list of engravings after the Kneller portrait is given
in Mr. F. O’Donoghue’s “Catalogue of Engraved
English Portraits in the British Museum.”</p>

<p>This important work forms a complete survey of the Architecture,
Decoration, and Furniture of the famous Adelphi Brethren, and constitutes
a monumental record of the Adam style. Although during
the Greek and Gothic Revivals Adam architecture was freely destroyed,
there still remains, as these volumes prove, a marvelous wealth of
work, much of which is complete with the actual Furniture, Carpets,
and Hangings made to his designs. No country in the world can show
equivalent instances of such historical preservation as are illustrated in
these magnificent volumes.</p>

<p>In this volume Sir Theodore Cook presents a pageant of the great
figures who surrounded the throne of such kings as François Premier
and Louis Quatorze. Louis of Orleans at Pierrefonds, the Duke of
Guise at Blois, Fouquet at Vaux le Vicomte and Condé at Chantilly—these
are typical of the story that the author unfolds, with a grasp so

in the neighbourhood of the City. Then follows Venetia, with the
celebrated Malcontenta, Stra and Maser. The Lake District succeeds,
with Balbianello and the Borromenian Islands; and finally the
inexhaustible regions of Italian art at Genoa, renowned for superb
examples of palatial architecture and gardening art.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
